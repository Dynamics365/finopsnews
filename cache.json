Either to process it manually or to run some analysis on it (Or whatever reason you fancy). Unfortunately Visual studio only allows you to copy one result at a time from that window which doesnt make it very friendly. I had over 600 results  \nBring in AutoHotKey ! This is an extremely powerful scripting language. It runs off keyboard shortcuts, so you can run this from where your cursor is pointed at.\nFor my scenario, i managed to make it run with Ctrl + j and it goes through all the lines so quickly that VS doesnt skip to the source reference file.\nOnce installed, run it in the same context as Visual studio i.e.  is VS is running as an administrator then run the script as an administrator as well (So that VS doesnt capture the hotkeys and keep it to itself)\nhttps://github.com/shashisadasivan/MyScripts/blob/master/Misc/Visual%20Studio/VSCopySymbolResult.ahk\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n  \n \n\n\n \n\n View this post on Instagram\n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nA post shared by Zia (@zia.the.dog)",

From that point you distribute it to all applicable environments.\nError?\nLast week, we did it all, but in LCS the KB number stood stuck on 167. I downloaded the KB again on my local VM, installed again, and there was no code change.  I verified my merge to the release branch and again, it was all fine.\n\nAs we inspect 6880717, we find that the file contains the changed source code and a Package Manifest xml file. This Package Manifest contains information about what is changed and the KB number.\n\n\n  \nThis information of the package manifest is also stored in VSTS in the AxUpdate map. The filename is in above case is 6880717.xml.  But there is no information about KB number in it.\nGood to know:\nHow do you know if you have this problem?
