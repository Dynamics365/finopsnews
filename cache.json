          "description": "What's it like developing using Git?\nDeveloping in VS with Git is easy but I wanted to call out a few changes. First, you don't need to manually add items to your repo. Your repo will have a .gitingore file that says what can be committed - and what can't. If your .gitIgnore file doesn't specifically ignore it, it will automatically be added. Also, your project folder will need to be in the package directory more than likely (or somewhere under source control in the same repo as your code). If you're using the more than 1 package approach, it can be shared if you like. Additionally, there is no source control explorer. You can compare your changes against the branch you're in but that's it. However, you don't really need source control explorer as a developer. If you're coding, you can do …",

In TFVC you may have a branch for each developer or a branch for development in general, another for test then a release branch. In Git, we will be using branches differently. We'll get a change request as a work item in DevOps, review it, create a branch, assign to a developer to do the work plus commit it, optional build automation may occur, next a pull request, or PR, with a review and then the changes are accepted into the parent branch. We'll walk through this in specific details. In this example, we'll be using a bug but you can replace \"bug\" with \"Feature\", \"Product Backlog Item\", \"Change Request\", \"Customization\", \"Enhancement\", or any other word …",

The main driver for which option you select is if you will only ever have 1 package in your code base or more than 1. This include any ISVs or any other item that will have a code footprint anywhere in F&O. To learn more about packages, please see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/dev-tools/models. \n1 Package as a Branch\nThis option is the simplest. You would have 1 package as a branch. A good example of this is this GitHub project. It's a small package that add a features, it only depends on OOTB F&O packages and models and has no other dependencies not does anything else depend on it. It doesn't get any more simple than this.

This post will cover how to setup Git for use with 1 package.\nTo learn out to create a Git repo in Azure DevOps, please refer to MSFT documentation. To learn how to create a repo on Github, please refer to GitHub documentation.\nUsing Azure DevOps\nIn your dev VM, open Visual Studio then open Team Explorer. Click on Manage Connections then Connect to a project. \n\nNext, select your repo and place it in your PackagesLocalDirectory. K drive on cloud hosted machines and C on VHDs. \n\nWait for it to clone and, that's it. Refresh your models like usual and you can develop against 1 package using Git in Azure DevOps. This is what the sync'd directory will look like. \n\nUsing GitHub\nIn your dev VM, open Visual Studio then open Team Explorer. Click on Manage Connections then click Clone \n\nLog into GitHub then select your repo making sure to change the local path to include your PackagesLocalDirectory path.\n\nClick clone and wait. That's it. Your repo folder will look like this:\n\nCallout: If using VHD, drive will be the C drive rather than K drive.\nConclusion\nVery straight forward process. However, when using this style of package manage, you will only ever be allowed 1 package. You can add as many models as you like but you'll only ever have 1 package. This includes ISV packages as well including binary or source packages. I recommend this style of management for personal projects or something you'll be sharing on GitHub. I wouldn't recommend this approach for use on an implementation project.\n \n\n\n\n\nView the discussion thread.\n\n\n\nReported:",

Let's review.\nThe process to get Git working with F&O can be a little involved and it may not make sense the first time. The issue we're presented with is that Git assumes you are starting with nothing - a directory that doesn't exist. When you fetch source code - clone it - Git wants you to clone it into a directory that doesn't exist yet. Our PackagesLocalDirectory very much so already exists. So, we have to help Git by moving in pieces of the repo into the directory then get everything back in working order. There are a few different ways to do this: The Hard Way, the easier way, and the easiest way.\n \nThe Hard Way\nWe'll be using https://github.com/…",

          "description": "what is a pull request? how do they work? what do they signify?\nCreate a Pull Request (PR)\nThe code is done but not the work. The developer still has to singal that his work is complete. We'll want to create a Pull Request or PR for short. There are 2 ways to do this. The first is in VS, which will just redirect you to Azure DevOps. The second is Azure DevOps. In VS, it can be found here:\n\nIn Azure DevOps, go to Repors, select your repo, select your branch then click \"create a pull request\".\n\nInside the PR, you can add some details for the PR. Additionally, reviewers and actions can be configured inside DevOps.\n\nNotice you can select what you are creating a PR into. You can set a reviewer or additional reviewer if you'd like. Also notice that the PR is automagically associated with out bug work item. Let's create the PR.\n\nAs you can see, it merged successfully on its own and now we, or the approver, can approve and complete. Typically we wouldn't approve our own PRs. We'll see this when we complete.\n\nWe'll have an option for the merge type, if we want to use something different. Additionally, we have \"complete associate work items after merging\" checked as well as \"delete bug200 after merging\". This will resolve the bug setting it's status to done and deleting the branch we created for the work item called \"bug200\". Next, click \"Complete merge\". This is what the bug work item looks like after completing the PR:\n\nThe work item's status is \"Done\". Also note the links section. We can see that we had a commit and PR. However, the link to branch is now gone because the branch itself is gone.\nConclusion\nBecause Git Branches allow us to pull everything up, rather the push specific changesets like in TFVC, we can more easily keep track of what is where. As a for instance, until bug 200's work gets a completed PR, I know it's only in the branch for that work item.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \nBlog Main Tag: \nGit",

However, if you try to do it using addLink method:\nqbdsInventBatch.clearDynalinks();\nqbdsInventBatch.addLink(fieldnum(InventDim, inventBatchId), fieldNum(InventBatch, inventBatchId));\nqbdsInventBatch.addLink(fieldnum(InventSum, ItemId), fieldNum(InventBatch, ItemId));\nInvalid Field/Related field combination\":\n\n\nThere are a few tricks how this can be resolved:\n\n\n1.

Start query from Inventbatch data source and then join to it InventSum and InventDim. However, considering the example above in most cases it will not be logical. But it might work in your case.\n3. Use extended ranges. The solution will have the following look:\nQueryBuildRange qbrItemId = SysQuery::findOrCreateRange(qbdsInventBatch, fieldNum(InventBatch, ItemId));\nstr itemIdRange = strFmt('(%1.%2=%3.%4)', qbdsInventBatch.name(), fieldStr(InventBatch, ItemId), _inventSum_DS_Query.dataSourceName(formDataSourceStr(InventOnhandItem, InventSum)).name(), fieldStr(InventSum, ItemId));\nqbrItemId.value(itemIdRange);\nAdditional query build extended range example",

Other relations restrict the rows by comparing values in each row to values in a row in another table.\n\n\n\nIn Microsoft Dynamics 365 there …",

In this article I will explain, how to make a field mandatory in dynamics 365 without customization or without writing any x++ codes.\n\n\n\nIn previous versions of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations (D365F&O), making a field mandatory required a (small) customisation. With version 10.0.0.12 this is no longer the case. Now it is possible to make fields mandatory using personalisation.\n\n \nBy using personalization, you can make a field mandatory writing a single piece of  x++ code.\n How to do this…\n In the following example, I would like to show you how to make Search Name field of Vendor form mandatory.\n To do this, \n  1. Simply right-click on the Search Name field of Vendor form. \n  2. Select the personalization option from the menu as shown in the below screen shot.\n\n\n  \n\n 3. A black color popup menu will open, then tick the “Required” option from the menu.\n\n\n \n \n  4. Then Click on the Close button in the following popup. \n\n\n\nNow Search Name field of Vendor form is mandatory, and you can see a red and marked with an asteriskswhen updating or saving the record without filling any value in the Search Name field.\n\n\nIn the above example, I think it is very clear the concept,  how to make a field mandatory in dynamics 365 without customization, if this article is useful for you, please try to share this article with your friends who are looking for a career in dynamics 365.

A model is a design-time concept, for example, a warehouse management model or a project accounting model. A model always belongs to a package. A package is a deployment and compilation unit of one or more models. It includes model metadata, binaries, and other associated resources. One or more packages can be packaged into a deploy…",

The application objects in the standard application can never be deleted.\nThe bottom layer would be the SYS layer, which is where the standard application code resides and is accessible only to Microsoft.

          "description": "Union query may be a very efficient and useful option when you need to fetch similar data fields from different tables. A good example of this may be the case when you to gather information about project related transactions as they can be of different types, like, expenses, fees, items, etc. \nSay, we need to render some report collecting all these different types of transaction that can be posted against a given project and group them by a given financial dimension value in Project group. Let's see how Union query can help us.\nIn order to better understand the goal, you can take a look to the standard form ProjInvoiceJournal which perfectly explains how all these table relate to each other. \n\nMost of them contain the same set of fields, and we simply need to get some of them into one view to populate by the report data provider.\nSo, at the first step, let's create all necessary queries for the source Project transaction related tables. Pick up the first and create a simple query as depicted. \n\n\n\nThen create a view based on this query. \n\nThen pick up the next and do the same.\n\n\nComplete these two steps for all necessary transaction types.\nNow you can create a Union query and add all your views together as they have the same set of fields.\n\n\nIf you need to distinguish them later who is who, say, in computed column methods, you can use  unionAllBranchId field, but this is out of the current focus.\n\nFinally you can elaborate it by adding a new view based on the latter with a simple SUM aggregation for Amount field.\n\n\nBasically, you achieve your goal with no coding.\nI am not going into details about the whole project, which you can get by this URL https://github.com/wojzeh/tmxProjectSalesPerSegment. Ping me, if you have any questions.\n\n\nRelated topics: \nComputed column for union values from multiple outer joined data sources in view",

          "description": "Engineering and construction projects are mostly offered at a fixed price and almost every time require a down payment from the client. In Dynamics 365 for Finance, this is reflected by a Fixed-price project. Our accountants wish to book the advance payment invoice in the Balance sheet (Liability) and the partial or final invoice in the Profit & Loss section (Turnover). Yet in the case of a Fixed fee project, there is no difference between down, partial and final payments in standard Dynamics 365 for Finance: everything is a milestone with a certain amount. We suggest creating a special VAT group to control the Advance payment milestone ledger integration.\nThe post Advance payment invoices in Fixed fee projects in D365, D-A-CH style appeared first on ER-Consult.",

To connect to test environment RDP, you need to create Whitelist rule for your IP address \n\nConnect RDP and open SSMS\n\nConnect to SQL server using Server name from LCS and add the prefix to SQL server name – servername.database.windows.net\n\nCreate a new query to test DB\nBelow query will create a new user that will be used for debugging\nCREATE USER devtempuser WITH PASSWORD = ‘pass@word1’\nEXEC sp_addrolemember ‘db_owner’, ‘devtempuser’\n\n\nWhitelist your IP address\nSelect new query against Master DB\nexec sp_set_firewall_rule N’DEVNAME’, ‘IP’, ‘IP’ \n\nStop IIS, WWW service and Batch Service\nOpen IIS and stop the service. Open run and enter services.msc and stop WWW and Microsoft D365 batch service\n\nEdit Web config\nGo to C:\\AosService\\webroot\\web.config and save the original file somewhere else as backup. Modify 4 Keys as per the below screenshot.\nYou can either comment original configuration or delete it and add new configuration of the sandbox environment\n\nStart IIS and WWW services\nStart IIS and WWW service stopped in step 5. Don’t start batch service.\n\nOpen the development environment AX URL\nIf you get 503 unavailable error, go to CMD(as admin) and type IISRESET\n\nDebug\nNow sandbox environment is connected to your development environment. You can simply open Visual studio to add breakpoints to X++ object and attach w3wp.exe service to debug.\n\nThanks Pawan Deep SinghI \n\nReference: https://axparadise.com/how-to-debug-the-sandbox-test-environment-in-d365fo/",

          "description": "One thing I appreciate about subscriptions is the automatic renewal process. It's nice to sign up for a subscription and not have to worry about manually renewing every time the contract period is up. This brings in automatic revenue for the company and keeps the hassle of manually renewing out of everyone's hands. \nFortunately, the process for setting up renewals in Subscription billing in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations is fairly simple to execute as well. Let's dive in! \n\n\nRenewing Subscriptions\nThe process to renew a subscription set up in D365FO Subscription billing is done on the Billing schedule itself. When setting up your customer's billing schedule, there is a button to Renew automatically on the Billing schedule header. If this subscription should be renewed automatically, select this toggle and specify how many lines to add per renewal. \n\n\nSet the toggle for Renew automatically and specify how many lines to add per renewal\n\n\nIn my example above, I have a short billing cycle set for one quarter. I set the toggle for Renew automatically to Yes and Lines to add per renewal to 1. \nOnce I invoiced the period, a new renewal line gets added to the Renewal section in the Line details for the line being renewed. The line shows who renewed it, the date it was renewed, and that it is, in fact, a renewal. \n\n\nSee the renewals in Line details\n\n\nIf I navigate to View billing detail on the line, there is now a new billing line to be invoiced. This is the first automatic renewal line! \n\n\nBilling details now show a new line to be invoiced\n\n\nAutomatic renewals allow users to set up a billing schedule and continually renew the subscription until the customer decides to terminate it.",

          "description": "From time to time, we have all ended a subscription service. It happens - maybe the service doesn't meet your needs anymore. Perhaps it has gotten too expensive. Regardless of the reason, it is a common occurrence and Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance's Subscription billing module has a solution for terminating subscriptions.\nNow you are probably thinking, \"Oh great, something complex to add to my never-ending duties...\" \nNope! Terminating a Billing schedule in the Subscription billing module is easy, and I am going to walk through it. \n\n\n\"I'll be back... when I am ready to subscribe again\"\n\n\nTerminating the Billing Schedule\n\n\nWithin the Billing schedule, you may notice that there are options surrounding Terminations. When you initially set up the Billing schedule, a Termination type will default onto the Billing schedule header. This field can be modified.\n\n\n\n\nThe three options are:\n\n\n\nAdjust schedule\nBill remaining\nNo adjustment\n\n\n\nThe defaulted Termination type comes from the Recurring contract billing parameters found at Subscription billing > Recurring contract billing > Setup > Recurring contract billing parameters. \n\n\n\n\nRecurring contract billing parameters\n\n\n\nTerminating Recurring Billing\n\n\nOnce on the Billing schedule screen for your Customer, there is an option to Terminate in the Billing schedule tab on the ribbon.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the Terminate dropdown is selected, there are options to: \n\n\n\nSelect a Termination date\nSelect the Termination type\nSelect the Credit option\nChoose to Prorate daily (or not)\nSelect a Reason code\nProvide Termination notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the fields are populated, select to Terminate or Terminate with refund. All billing schedule lines will be terminated based on the date selected. \n\n\n\n\nOnce the Termination is complete, a notification will alert you to how many lines were terminated, and Termination can be removed from the account by selecting Remove termination in the ribbon.",

Let's look at the differences. \n\n\nThis letter is not the only difference between these words!\n\n\n\nDeprecate - There are several meanings behind the word deprecate, but as it relates to ERP system features and functionality, it means that the use of features and functionality are actively being discouraged because they have been superseded, or replaced, with different functionality. It doesn't necessarily mean the functionality is going away, but it will no longer be supported, and users are often actively encouraged to stop using it. \nHere is a link to D365FO's \"Removed or deprecated features home page\" - Removed or deprecated features home page - Finance & Operations | Dynamics 365 | Microsoft Learn\n\n\n\n\nRemoved or deprecated features home page\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciate - This is a term used in finance, typically with fixed assets as it relates to D365FO, to show the diminishing value of the asset over a period of time. \n\n\n\n\nDepreciation profiles for Fixed assets in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance",

This has been a much-needed change, and I am happy to report on it!\nSequencing of Blocking Rules\n\n\nIn the past, Blocking rules in Credit management have all run, regardless of what happened on another Blocking rule. \nThis could cause frustration if a company wanted to stop processing once specific criteria had been met. \nAs of version 10.0.21, you may have noticed some new options within the Blocking rules form. \nWhen setting up Blocking rules, there is a new column within all Blocking rules labeled \"Release sales order.\" This can only be enabled on an Exclusion rule type.\n\n\nWhat this \"Release sales order\" toggle does, is it allows for an Exclusion rule to bypass all other Blocking rules and process the Sales order if it meets the Exclusion criteria. \nTypically, Blocking rules get processed before Exclusion rules, and an Exclusion rule on the same level as the Blocking rule will not exclude that Blocking rule. This is the exception to that rule. \n\n\nNew Sequence of Blocking Rules\n\n\nExclusion rule with Release Sales order checked\nBlocking rules (Run in Table, Group, then All sequence)\nExclusion rules (Run in Table, Group, then All sequence)\n\n\nHaving rules in place surrounding how Blocking rules are run is a massive improvement. Here is the link to the documentation within Microsoft Docs: Credit holds for sales orders - Finance | Dynamics 365 | Microsoft Docs",

          "description": "Some big changes were made to Credit management in recent versions that need to be addressed. One of which is the following parameter: \nBypass inventory reservations\n\n\n\n\nA new parameter has appeared called Bypass inventory reservations, but what does it mean?\n\n\n\n\nRelease to Warehouse Credit Management Hold\n\n\nThere have been some observations made that when using the Release to warehouse Credit management checkpoint, the Sales order gets stuck in an infinite loop of going back on Credit hold after being released. This is occurring even if the order is Released to warehouse within the grace days defined. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Release to warehouse Credit management checkpoint in Credit and collections parameters\n\n\n\nMicrosoft has quietly released a fix for this in version 10.0.19 that is called Bypass inventory reservations. When this is enabled in the Credit and collections parameters, it will disregard inventory reservations when checking credit management blocking rules. Likewise, it will enable checkpoint grace periods regardless of inventory reservation quantity. \n\n\n\n\n\nEnable the Bypass inventory reservations parameter to avoid the Release to warehouse credit hold loop!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has been a lifesaver for people who have found themselves stuck in an endless loop of Credit management holds when they try to release their Sales order from Credit hold then try to Release to warehouse!",
