This new feature in PowerPlatform can clearly help \r\nyou building an easy chatbot with a lot of datasources, including of course \r\nthe whole eco-system of Microsoft, but as well as the 300 connectors of the \r\nPowerAutomate. In this article. I will present in this article of course \r\nthis AI feature connected to Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations. In the \r\nERP, you could of course build a BOT for Commerce or Retail, Customer \r\nService (Return product) or even Lead generation etc….\r\n\r\nPower Virtual Agents empowers teams to easily create powerful bots using a \r\nguided, no-code graphical interface without the need for data scientists or \r\ndevelopers. Power Virtual Agents addresses many of the major issues with \r\nbot building in the industry today. It eliminates the gap between the \r\nsubject matter experts and the development teams building the bots, and the \r\nlong latency between teams recognizing an issue and updating the bot to \r\naddress it. It removes the complexity of exposing teams to the nuances of \r\nconversational AI and the need to write complex code. And, it minimizes the \r\nIT effort required to deploy and maintain a custom conversational solution. \r\nSo… let’s jump in !!",

          "description": "Part 1 of the series introduced OpenXML. This post will provide an example how to use OpenXML library to export data from AX. (Full example can be downloaded here.)\nFirst of all, a Session object is needed. It will be available if the method is called from AX. However, it is much easier/faster to test/debug using Visual studio alone. Therefore, add the following code to create a Session if necessary.\n            \n// Create a Session object and login if necessary\nif (MIL.Session.Current == null)\n{    MIL.Session axSession = new MIL.Session();\n    axSession.Logon(null, null, null, null);\n}\nThe next thing is the SharedStringTable.

Unfortunately Visual studio only allows you to copy one result at a time from that window which doesnt make it very friendly. I had over 600 results  \nBring in AutoHotKey ! This is an extremely powerful scripting language. It runs off keyboard shortcuts, so you can run this from where your cursor is pointed at.\nFor my scenario, i managed to make it run with Ctrl + j and it goes through all the lines so quickly that VS doesnt skip to the source reference file.\nOnce installed, run it in the same context as Visual studio i.e.  is VS is running as an administrator then run the script as an administrator as well (So that VS doesnt capture the hotkeys and keep it to itself)\nhttps://github.com/shashisadasivan/MyScripts/blob/master/Misc/Visual%20Studio/VSCopySymbolResult.ahk\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n  \n \n\n\n \n\n View this post on Instagram\n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nA post shared by Zia (@zia.the.dog)",

From that point you distribute it to all applicable environments.\nError?\nLast week, we did it all, but in LCS the KB number stood stuck on 167. I downloaded the KB again on my local VM, installed again, and there was no code change.  I verified my merge to the release branch and again, it was all fine.\n\nAs we inspect 6880717, we find that the file contains the changed source code and a Package Manifest xml file.
