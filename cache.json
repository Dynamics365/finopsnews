We need to look carefully not just at the seller with the highest close rate, but also balance that with their availability and expertise to attend to the customer’s needs and requirements.  \nApplying the right business tactic to close a deal at the right moment is the second key to success. We must recognize where the buyer is in their sales journey and employ the right action to engage. If we can use technology to help provide…",

If you've never used either toolkit, you can stop reading now.\nWhat's changing\nThe custom help toolkits started out as a way to connect your own help content to Dynamics 365 and to customize Microsoft's help content. But times change, technology changes with them, and we no longer recommend that you customize our content. Instead, we recommend that you create your own help content using any tools you prefer, and then let that override Microsoft's content.\nAfter April 11, 2023, the toolkits will be archived.\nWe're also removing content from our contributor guides that encourages customizing our content. Everyone can still contribute to our documentation, but in English only.\nWhy are you making this change?\nThe custom help toolkits are being used less and less. We know custom solutions are still running on versions that are or soon will be unsupported. We expect those migration projects will be complex enough that existing custom help can't be easily reused.\nIf you find that you need one of the tools in the archived toolkits, you can download a release package and extract the one you need.\nWhat about custom help?\nIf you develop a solution that's based on Dynamics 365, you should continue to deliver documentation for its users. Use any tools you prefer.\nIf your solution includes Dynamics 365 Finance, Supply Chain Management, or Commerce, and you need to connect your content to the in-product help pane, download the AzureSearchCustomHelp solution.

This gives companies the ability to better and faster determine whether additional inventory is needed within a picking zone. The setup for the new feature is very similar to location-based replenishment. As new replenishment template is created for min/max replenishment, the user can simply specify whether the threshold should be evaluated per Location or per Zone. In case of zones, specific zones are then added to the Zone selection query and those will be evaluated by the newly created replenishment template when processed. Just like location-based min/max replenishment, the zone-based min/max replenishment is based on setting up a minimum threshold of inventory that triggers the creation of replenishment work order for selected items and item variants. In return, replenishment will be created for quantity that increases inventory up to the desired zone maximum threshold.",

On enabling this feature, this parallel processing will be activated and task configurations will be created for all warehouses from all legal entities that have \"Use warehouse management processes\" enabled. Each task configuration includes a setting that lets you define the number of tasks that will run simultaneously (which is equivalent to the number of parallel processes). Roughly, the time used on the allocate-wave step (which is typically 30% to 60% of the total processing time) is reduced by a factor equivalent to the number of tasks. It’s also possible to define the batch group that will be assigned to process these tasks. When this feature is enabled, all legal entities will process waves in batches and \"Wait for lock\" will be set to a default value of 60,000 ms if it was previously set to 0 ms. Other than this, the existing task and wave processing configurations will be kept for all warehouses that are already configured to process waves in batches, and for all warehouses that are already configured to use the allocateWave method in parallel. After enabling this feature, all new legal entities will be configured by default to process waves in batches, \"Wait for lock\" will be set to a default value of 60,000 ms, and all new warehouses with \"Use warehouse management processes\" enabled will have the allocateWave method configured to run in parallel by default.

I thought I'd provide a simple Power Shell script to show what can be done. You can make this more user friendly or modern by putting it in Power Automate or using a Logic App. For reference, the API specs and available operations can be found at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/dat...\n \nRequest A Database Backup\nYou can request a database backup on an environment like so:\n# Update these values for your situation\nhttps://login.microsoftonline.com/{DOMAIN}/oauth2/v2.0/token\"       \nUSER@DOMAIN.COM}'\nhttps://lcsapi.lcs.dynamics.com\"\n# Install Azure PowerShell\n# Install D365FO.Tools\n# Install D365FO.Integrations\nGet-D365LcsApiToken -ClientId $ClientId -Username $Username -Password $Password -LcsApiUri $LcsApiUri -Verbose | Set-D365LcsApiConfig\nInvoke-D365LcsDatabaseExport -ProjectId $ProjectId -SourceEnvironmentId $SourceEnvironmentId -BackupName $BackupName -LcsApiUri $LcsApiUri -Verbose\n \nUsing that as a starting point, you can use this script to create a pipeline.

This post will cover how to setup Git for use with 1 package.\nTo learn out to create a Git repo in Azure DevOps, please refer to MSFT documentation. To learn how to create a repo on Github, please refer to GitHub documentation.\nUsing Azure DevOps\nIn your dev VM, open Visual Studio then open Team Explorer. Click on Manage Connections then Connect to a project. \n\nNext, select your repo and place it in your PackagesLocalDirectory. K drive on cloud hosted machines and C on VHDs. \n\nWait for it to clone and, that's it. Refresh your models like usual and you can develop against 1 package using Git in Azure DevOps. This is what the sync'd directory will look like. \n\nUsing GitHub\nIn your dev VM, open Visual Studio then open Team Explorer. Click on Manage Connections then click Clone \n\nLog into GitHub then select your repo making sure to change the local path to include your PackagesLocalDirectory path.\n\nClick clone and wait. That's it. Your repo folder will look like this:\n\nCallout: If using VHD, drive will be the C drive rather than K drive.\nConclusion\nVery straight forward process. However, when using this style of package manage, you will only ever be allowed 1 package. You can add as many models as you like but you'll only ever have 1 package. This includes ISV packages as well including binary or source packages. I recommend this style of management for personal projects or something you'll be sharing on GitHub. I wouldn't recommend this approach for use on an implementation project.\n \n\n\n\n\nView the discussion thread.\n\n\n\nReported:",

When you fetch source code - clone it - Git wants you to clone it into a directory that doesn't exist yet. Our PackagesLocalDirectory very much so already exists. So, we have to help Git by moving in pieces of the repo into the directory then get everything back in working order.

Additionally, we have \"complete associate work items after merging\" checked as well as \"delete bug200 after merging\". This will resolve the bug setting it's status to done and deleting the branch we created for the work item called \"bug200\". Next, click \"Complete merge\". This is what the bug work item looks like after completing the PR:\n\nThe work item's status is \"Done\". Also note the links section. We can see that we had a commit and PR. However, the link to branch is now gone because the branch itself is gone.\nConclusion\nBecause Git Branches allow us to pull everything up, rather the push specific changesets like in TFVC, we can more easily keep track of what is where. As a for instance, until bug 200's work gets a completed PR, I know it's only in the branch for that work item.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \nBlog Main Tag: \nGit",

In this article I will explain, how to make a field mandatory in dynamics 365 without customization or without writing any x++ codes.\n\n\n\nIn previous versions of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations (D365F&O), making a field mandatory required a (small) customisation. With version 10.0.0.12 this is no longer the case. Now it is possible to make fields mandatory using personalisation.\n\n \nBy using personalization, you can make a field mandatory writing a single piece of  x++ code.\n How to do this…\n In the following example, I would like to show you how to make Search Name field of Vendor form mandatory.\n To do this, \n  1. Simply right-click on the Search Name field of Vendor form. \n  2. Select the personalization option from the menu as shown in the below screen shot.\n\n\n  \n\n 3. A black color popup menu will open, then tick the “Required” option from the menu.\n\n\n \n \n  4. Then Click on the Close button in the following popup. \n\n\n\nNow Search Name field of Vendor form is mandatory, and you can see a red and marked with an asteriskswhen updating or saving the record without filling any value in the Search Name field.\n\n\nIn the above example, I think it is very clear the concept,  how to make a field mandatory in dynamics 365 without customization, if this article is useful for you, please try to share this article with your friends who are looking for a career in dynamics 365.

The build process, X++ compilation, and generation of cross-reference information typically run satisfactorily on machines with 16 GB of memory and two CPU cores. The compiler uses available resources, so more RAM and more cores will speed up compilation, especially if there is contention for resources from other concurrent processes. If you run concurrent processes, we recommend 24 GB of memory with four cores. A minimum of two CPU cores is recommended because the developer environment contains many components running simultaneously. Components include AOS Web Application, Visual Studio, Management Reporter, and SQL Server.",

          "description": "Union query may be a very efficient and useful option when you need to fetch similar data fields from different tables. A good example of this may be the case when you to gather information about project related transactions as they can be of different types, like, expenses, fees, items, etc. \nSay, we need to render some report collecting all these different types of transaction that can be posted against a given project and group them by a given financial dimension value in Project group. Let's see how Union query can help us.\nIn order to better understand the goal, you can take a look to the standard form ProjInvoiceJournal which perfectly explains how all these table relate to each other. \n\nMost of them contain the same set of fields, and we simply need to get some of them into one view to populate by the report data provider.\nSo, at the first step, let's create all necessary queries for the source Project transaction related tables. Pick up the first and create a simple query as depicted. \n\n\n\nThen create a view based on this query. \n\nThen pick up the next and do the same.\n\n\nComplete these two steps for all necessary transaction types.\nNow you can create a Union query and add all your views together as they have the same set of fields.\n\n\nIf you need to distinguish them later who is who, say, in computed column methods, you can use  unionAllBranchId field, but this is out of the current focus.\n\nFinally you can elaborate it by adding a new view based on the latter with a simple SUM aggregation for Amount field.\n\n\nBasically, you achieve your goal with no coding.\nI am not going into details about the whole project, which you can get by this URL https://github.com/wojzeh/tmxProjectSalesPerSegment. Ping me, if you have any questions.\n\n\nRelated topics: \nComputed column for union values from multiple outer joined data sources in view",

Either to process it manually or to run some analysis on it (Or whatever reason you fancy). Unfortunately Visual studio only allows you to copy one result at a time from that window which doesnt make it very friendly. I had over 600 results  \nBring in AutoHotKey ! This is an extremely powerful scripting language. It runs off keyboard shortcuts, so you can run this from where your cursor is pointed at.\nFor my scenario, i managed to make it run with Ctrl + j and it goes through all the lines so quickly that VS doesnt skip to the source reference file.\nOnce installed, run it in the same context as Visual studio i.e.  is VS is running as an administrator then run the script as an administrator as well (So that VS doesnt capture the hotkeys and keep it to itself)\nhttps://github.com/shashisadasivan/MyScripts/blob/master/Misc/Visual%20Studio/VSCopySymbolResult.ahk\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n  \n \n\n\n \n\n View this post on Instagram\n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nA post shared by Zia (@zia.the.dog)",

In Dynamics 365 for Finance, this is reflected by a Fixed-price project. Our accountants wish to book the advance payment invoice in the Balance sheet (Liability) and the partial or final invoice in the Profit & Loss section (Turnover). Yet in the case of a Fixed fee project, there is no difference between down, partial and final payments in standard Dynamics 365 for Finance: everything is a milestone with a certain amount.

To connect to test environment RDP, you need to create Whitelist rule for your IP address \n\nConnect RDP and open SSMS\n\nConnect to SQL server using Server name from LCS and add the prefix to SQL server name – servername.database.windows.net\n\nCreate a new query to test DB\nBelow query will create a new user that will be used for debugging\nCREATE USER devtempuser WITH PASSWORD = ‘pass@word1’\nEXEC sp_addrolemember ‘db_owner’, ‘devtempuser’\n\n\nWhitelist your IP address\nSelect new query against Master DB\nexec sp_set_firewall_rule N’DEVNAME’, ‘IP’, ‘IP’ \n\nStop IIS, WWW service and Batch Service\nOpen IIS and stop the service. Open run and enter services.msc and stop WWW and Microsoft D365 batch service\n\nEdit Web config\nGo to C:\\AosService\\webroot\\web.config and save the original file somewhere else as backup. Modify 4 Keys as per the below screenshot.\nYou can either comment original configuration or delete it and add new configuration of the sandbox environment\n\nStart IIS and WWW services\nStart IIS and WWW service stopped in step 5. Don’t start batch service.\n\nOpen the development environment AX URL\nIf you get 503 unavailable error, go to CMD(as admin) and type IISRESET\n\nDebug\nNow sandbox environment is connected to your development environment. You can simply open Visual studio to add breakpoints to X++ object and attach w3wp.exe service to debug.\n\nThanks Pawan Deep SinghI \n\nReference: https://axparadise.com/how-to-debug-the-sandbox-test-environment-in-d365fo/",

          "description": "One thing I appreciate about subscriptions is the automatic renewal process. It's nice to sign up for a subscription and not have to worry about manually renewing every time the contract period is up. This brings in automatic revenue for the company and keeps the hassle of manually renewing out of everyone's hands. \nFortunately, the process for setting up renewals in Subscription billing in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations is fairly simple to execute as well. Let's dive in! \n\n\nRenewing Subscriptions\nThe process to renew a subscription set up in D365FO Subscription billing is done on the Billing schedule itself. When setting up your customer's billing schedule, there is a button to Renew automatically on the Billing schedule header. If this subscription should be renewed automatically, select this toggle and specify how many lines to add per renewal. \n\n\nSet the toggle for Renew automatically and specify how many lines to add per renewal\n\n\nIn my example above, I have a short billing cycle set for one quarter. I set the toggle for Renew automatically to Yes and Lines to add per renewal to 1. \nOnce I invoiced the period, a new renewal line gets added to the Renewal section in the Line details for the line being renewed. The line shows who renewed it, the date it was renewed, and that it is, in fact, a renewal. \n\n\nSee the renewals in Line details\n\n\nIf I navigate to View billing detail on the line, there is now a new billing line to be invoiced. This is the first automatic renewal line! \n\n\nBilling details now show a new line to be invoiced\n\n\nAutomatic renewals allow users to set up a billing schedule and continually renew the subscription until the customer decides to terminate it.",

          "description": "From time to time, we have all ended a subscription service. It happens - maybe the service doesn't meet your needs anymore. Perhaps it has gotten too expensive. Regardless of the reason, it is a common occurrence and Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance's Subscription billing module has a solution for terminating subscriptions.\nNow you are probably thinking, \"Oh great, something complex to add to my never-ending duties...\" \nNope! Terminating a Billing schedule in the Subscription billing module is easy, and I am going to walk through it. \n\n\n\"I'll be back... when I am ready to subscribe again\"\n\n\nTerminating the Billing Schedule\n\n\nWithin the Billing schedule, you may notice that there are options surrounding Terminations. When you initially set up the Billing schedule, a Termination type will default onto the Billing schedule header. This field can be modified.\n\n\n\n\nThe three options are:\n\n\n\nAdjust schedule\nBill remaining\nNo adjustment\n\n\n\nThe defaulted Termination type comes from the Recurring contract billing parameters found at Subscription billing > Recurring contract billing > Setup > Recurring contract billing parameters. \n\n\n\n\nRecurring contract billing parameters\n\n\n\nTerminating Recurring Billing\n\n\nOnce on the Billing schedule screen for your Customer, there is an option to Terminate in the Billing schedule tab on the ribbon.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the Terminate dropdown is selected, there are options to: \n\n\n\nSelect a Termination date\nSelect the Termination type\nSelect the Credit option\nChoose to Prorate daily (or not)\nSelect a Reason code\nProvide Termination notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the fields are populated, select to Terminate or Terminate with refund. All billing schedule lines will be terminated based on the date selected. \n\n\n\n\nOnce the Termination is complete, a notification will alert you to how many lines were terminated, and Termination can be removed from the account by selecting Remove termination in the ribbon.",

          "description": "Something happened while I wasn't looking and now we have a clearer sequencing of Credit management Blocking rules. This has been a much-needed change, and I am happy to report on it!\nSequencing of Blocking Rules\n\n\nIn the past, Blocking rules in Credit management have all run, regardless of what happened on another Blocking rule. \nThis could cause frustration if a company wanted to stop processing once specific criteria had been met. \nAs of version 10.0.21, you may have noticed some new options within the Blocking rules form. \nWhen setting up Blocking rules, there is a new column within all Blocking rules labeled \"Release sales order.\" This can only be enabled on an Exclusion rule type.\n\n\nWhat this \"Release sales order\" toggle does, is it allows for an Exclusion rule to bypass all other Blocking rules and process the Sales order if it meets the Exclusion criteria. \nTypically, Blocking rules get processed before Exclusion rules, and an Exclusion rule on the same level as the Blocking rule will not exclude that Blocking rule. This is the exception to that rule. \n\n\nNew Sequence of Blocking Rules\n\n\nExclusion rule with Release Sales order checked\nBlocking rules (Run in Table, Group, then All sequence)\nExclusion rules (Run in Table, Group, then All sequence)\n\n\nHaving rules in place surrounding how Blocking rules are run is a massive improvement.

One of which is the following parameter: \nBypass inventory reservations\n\n\n\n\nA new parameter has appeared called Bypass inventory reservations, but what does it mean?\n\n\n\n\nRelease to Warehouse Credit Management Hold\n\n\nThere have been some observations made that when using the Release to warehouse Credit management checkpoint, the Sales order gets stuck in an infinite loop of going back on Credit hold after being released. This is occurring even if the order is Released to warehouse within the grace days defined. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Release to warehouse Credit management checkpoint in Credit and collections parameters\n\n\n\nMicrosoft has quietly released a fix for this in version 10.0.19 that is called Bypass inventory reservations. When this is enabled in the Credit and collections parameters, it will disregard inventory reservations when checking credit management blocking rules. Likewise, it will enable checkpoint grace periods regardless of inventory reservation quantity. \n\n\n\n\n\nEnable the Bypass inventory reservations parameter to avoid the Release to warehouse credit hold loop!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has been a lifesaver for people who have found themselves stuck in an endless loop of Credit management holds when they try to release their Sales order from Credit hold then try to Release to warehouse!",
