You can test your application against the storage services locally without creating an Azure subscription or incurring any costs. When you’re satisfied with how your application is working in the emulator, switch to using an Azure storage account in the cloud.\nIn Dynamics 365 finance and operations onebox environment, we also use Microsoft Azure Storage Emulator for same purposes. There is a common problem when you try to start its service or using Data entity Import/Export\n\nPort conflict with existing application\n{:.error}\nReason\nBy default, Azure storage emulator is using port number 10000, 10001, 10002 for Blob, Queue and Table services respectively. And there is a progress/system takes those ports already, so you are not able to start its service.\nWe can simply use this command in CMD to see which one has conflict\nnetstat -p tcp -ano | findstr :10001\n\nThe process ID 4 is currently taking port 10001.\nResolution\nYou can either terminate the conflict program or change the default port for Azure Storage Emulator.\nTo determine the conflict program we can use this command in CMD\nRun following command to check which application/process has the same port, then simply go to task manager and terminate it.\ntasklist /fi \"pid eq 4\"\n\nTo change the default port for Azure storage Emulator\nGo to your storage emulator default installation folder, which is located at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Azure\\Storage Emulator, open the AzureStorageEmulator.exe.config by notepad and edit the port number to different number\n\nWhen done, try to start its service again using\nAzureStorageEmulator.exe start\n\nThank you for reading.",

This is useful if you want to specifically state do nothing so that someone else doesn’t try to correct what seems to be an omission.\nRestricted:\nThis will prevent the record from being deleted if there are records in the related table that match the selected relation. This occurs within the validateDelete table event, which is called by the delete table event.\nCascade:\nThis will delete the record in the related table, based on the relation. Ex: A sales order line is of no use without a sales order. This is an extension of the delete table event.\nCascade + Restricted\nThis is a little special. In a two-table scenario, it is the same as Restricted. It will stop the record from being deleted if a related record exists. But if the record is being deleted as part of a cascade from a table related to it, the records will be deleted.\nfor more infomation about how to create DeleteActions at MSDN.",

This gives companies the ability to better and faster determine whether additional inventory is needed within a picking zone. The setup for the new feature is very similar to location-based replenishment. As new replenishment template is created for min/max replenishment, the user can simply specify whether the threshold should be evaluated per Location or per Zone. In case of zones, specific zones are then added to the Zone selection query and those will be evaluated by the newly created replenishment template when processed. Just like location-based min/max replenishment, the zone-based min/max replenishment is based on setting up a minimum threshold of inventory that triggers the creation of replenishment work order for selected items and item variants. In return, replenishment will be created for quantity that increases inventory up to the desired zone maximum threshold.",

On enabling this feature, this parallel processing will be activated and task configurations will be created for all warehouses from all legal entities that have \"Use warehouse management processes\" enabled. Each task configuration includes a setting that lets you define the number of tasks that will run simultaneously (which is equivalent to the number of parallel processes). Roughly, the time used on the allocate-wave step (which is typically 30% to 60% of the total processing time) is reduced by a factor equivalent to the number of tasks. It’s also possible to define the batch group that will be assigned to process these tasks. When this feature is enabled, all legal entities will process waves in batches and \"Wait for lock\" will be set to a default value of 60,000 ms if it was previously set to 0 ms. Other than this, the existing task and wave processing configurations will be kept for all warehouses that are already configured to process waves in batches, and for all warehouses that are already configured to use the allocateWave method in parallel. After enabling this feature, all new legal entities will be configured by default to process waves in batches, \"Wait for lock\" will be set to a default value of 60,000 ms, and all new warehouses with \"Use warehouse management processes\" enabled will have the allocateWave method configured to run in parallel by default.

In this article. I will present in this article of course \r\nthis AI feature connected to Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations. In the \r\nERP, you could of course build a BOT for Commerce or Retail, Customer \r\nService (Return product) or even Lead generation etc….\r\n\r\nPower Virtual Agents empowers teams to easily create powerful bots using a \r\nguided, no-code graphical interface without the need for data scientists or \r\ndevelopers. Power Virtual Agents addresses many of the major issues with \r\nbot building in the industry today. It eliminates the gap between the \r\nsubject matter experts and the development teams building the bots, and the \r\nlong latency between teams recognizing an issue and updating the bot to \r\naddress it. It removes the complexity of exposing teams to the nuances of \r\nconversational AI and the need to write complex code.

          "description": "Can you use Git Hub? yes.\nGitHub is also an option you could pursue when moving to Git. GitHub has a lot of new features and offerings that Azure DevOps does not have. However, there is basically no documentation from MSFT on how to configure builds and various other automation options in GitHub. I'm sure it's possible but there will be a fair amount of guess work. Getting your pipelines fully converted to YAML will be the first step in making the transition to GitHub.\nCommunity (Free)\nI use GitHub to host all of my community projects which is great for that. I can share the code and anyone can pick it up and use it as they see fit. Private repos are now also an option. However, these still below to a named person so you'd want a service account or centrally managed account to create all projects.\nPro\nFor 4 USD a month, you can upgrade 1 account on GitHub to GitHub Pro, which gives you more stuff. Using YAML plus actions, you could probably get a lot of the same benefits from Azure DevOps without having to use DevOps. \nThoughts\n I think the prospect of using Github for community or personal development for F&O is a good idea. Git is simple and so is GitHub. You can work and share your code with whomever you like. Additionally, private repos are now free so you can use those, too.\nHowever, the prospect of using Github for an implementation or support project is a much harder sell for the client or organization. While I'm pretty sure you could use GitHub to get to around the same service level as Azure DevOps, there is a fair amount of risk. That risk is, in my opinion, simply too great to suggest using it for the time being. There is nearly no documentation on the subject and there is no one at MSFT you can call for help specific to F&O. Although it may look like Azure DevOps isn't the favorite for MSFT in terms of product hype or feature development, DevOps is still a proven tool we can rely on. I got the chart below from this site but I think it's really helpful given the context.",

Unfortunately Visual studio only allows you to copy one result at a time from that window which doesnt make it very friendly. I had over 600 results  \nBring in AutoHotKey ! This is an extremely powerful scripting language. It runs off keyboard shortcuts, so you can run this from where your cursor is pointed at.\nFor my scenario, i managed to make it run with Ctrl + j and it goes through all the lines so quickly that VS doesnt skip to the source reference file.\nOnce installed, run it in the same context as Visual studio i.e.  is VS is running as an administrator then run the script as an administrator as well (So that VS doesnt capture the hotkeys and keep it to itself)\nhttps://github.com/shashisadasivan/MyScripts/blob/master/Misc/Visual%20Studio/VSCopySymbolResult.ahk\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n  \n \n\n\n \n\n View this post on Instagram\n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nA post shared by Zia (@zia.the.dog)",

We maken de nieuwe masterdata, en als deze taak is voltooid, moet je migreren naar de volgende topics.
