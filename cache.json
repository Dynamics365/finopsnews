Slotting allows users to gather consolidate demand by item and unit of measure from orders, in status either ordered, reserved, or release. Once demand has been generated, it can be located to locations that will be used for picking based on quantity, unit, physical dimensions, fixed locations, etc. Once the slot plan has been established, replenishment work can be created to bring the appropriate amount of inventory to each location.",

This gives companies the ability to better and faster determine whether additional inventory is needed within a picking zone. The setup for the new feature is very similar to location-based replenishment. As new replenishment template is created for min/max replenishment, the user can simply specify whether the threshold should be evaluated per Location or per Zone. In case of zones, specific zones are then added to the Zone selection query and those will be evaluated by the newly created replenishment template when processed. Just like location-based min/max replenishment, the zone-based min/max replenishment is based on setting up a minimum threshold of inventory that triggers the creation of replenishment work order for selected items and item variants. In return, replenishment will be created for quantity that increases inventory up to the desired zone maximum threshold.",

On enabling this feature, this parallel processing will be activated and task configurations will be created for all warehouses from all legal entities that have \"Use warehouse management processes\" enabled. Each task configuration includes a setting that lets you define the number of tasks that will run simultaneously (which is equivalent to the number of parallel processes). Roughly, the time used on the allocate-wave step (which is typically 30% to 60% of the total processing time) is reduced by a factor equivalent to the number of tasks. It’s also possible to define the batch group that will be assigned to process these tasks. When this feature is enabled, all legal entities will process waves in batches and \"Wait for lock\" will be set to a default value of 60,000 ms if it was previously set to 0 ms. Other than this, the existing task and wave processing configurations will be kept for all warehouses that are already configured to process waves in batches, and for all warehouses that are already configured to use the allocateWave method in parallel. After enabling this feature, all new legal entities will be configured by default to process waves in batches, \"Wait for lock\" will be set to a default value of 60,000 ms, and all new warehouses with \"Use warehouse management processes\" enabled will have the allocateWave method configured to run in parallel by default. Existing warehouses for which you change \"Use warehouse management processes\" from \"no\" to \"yes\" will also run this method in parallel by default.",

Once an \r\nentity is enabled for Dual Write, any create, update change in Dynamics 365 \r\nFinance and Operations results in writes, in near-real time, to the Common \r\nData Service and vice versa.\r\n\r\nFor example, a change in the Customer entity in Dynamics 365 Finance and \r\nOperations is reflected in near-real time in the Account entity in the \r\nDynamics 365 Sales and vice-versa. While all this happens with minimal \r\nsetup, an advanced user interface is provided with drag and drop mapping \r\nand transformation capabilities for all your customization needs. Quite \r\nmagical!\r\n\r\nLet’s jump in !",

Using YAML plus actions, you could probably get a lot of the same benefits from Azure DevOps without having to use DevOps. \nThoughts\n I think the prospect of using Github for community or personal development for F&O is a good idea. Git is simple and so is GitHub. You can work and share your code with whomever you like. Additionally, private repos are now free so you can use those, too.\nHowever, the prospect of using Github for an implementation or support project is a much harder sell for the client or organization. While I'm pretty sure you could use GitHub to get to around the same service level as Azure DevOps, there is a fair amount of risk. That risk is, in my opinion, simply too great to suggest using it for the time being. There is nearly no documentation on the subject and there is no one at MSFT you can call for help specific to F&O. Although it may look like Azure DevOps isn't the favorite for MSFT in terms of product hype or feature development, DevOps is still a proven tool we can rely on.

The main driver for which option you select is if you will only ever have 1 package in your code base or more than 1. This include any ISVs or any other item that will have a code footprint anywhere in F&O.

Both have their results exposed via OData but computed columns also present in the DMF when exporting (plus importing with some extra code).  \nWhat's a computed column?\nDocumentation on this can be found here. In simple terms, it is a field that is calculated whenever the data entity is executed. This is done by the view for the data entity and not with X++. The location where this type of column is populated, on the SQL server rather than the AOS, is an important distinction. This means that SQL sever i…",

Dynamics 365 For Finance and Operations recently added Priority-based Throttling. In the past, when hitting an OData endpoint, we only had to worry about non-affirmative timeouts; it took longer than 120 seconds to complete. It didn't specifically matter to me, the consumer of an endpoint, what else Finance and Ops may have going on. Now, with priority-based throttling, it is my problem as a consumer. I now get affirmative decline in the form of a 429 HTTP return code.\nWhen does throttling occur?\nI'd suggest you review the FAQ for Priority-Based Throttling. However, in…",

Unfortunately Visual studio only allows you to copy one result at a time from that window which doesnt make it very friendly. I had over 600 results  \nBring in AutoHotKey ! This is an extremely powerful scripting language. It runs off keyboard shortcuts, so you can run this from where your cursor is pointed at.\nFor my scenario, i managed to make it run with Ctrl + j and it goes through all the lines so quickly that VS doesnt skip to the source reference file.\nOnce installed, run it in the same context as Visual studio i.e.  is VS is running as an administrator then run the script as an administrator as well (So that VS doesnt capture the hotkeys and keep it to itself)\nhttps://github.com/shashisadasivan/MyScripts/blob/master/Misc/Visual%20Studio/VSCopySymbolResult.ahk\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n  \n \n\n\n \n\n View this post on Instagram\n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nA post shared by Zia (@zia.the.dog)",

There are quite a few “enhancements” i have added that certainly makes my development life a bit easier.\nThe Add-in however only works from the Object designer instead of the AOT nodes, which is most of the times a good thing especially when you are searching for code via the code editor.\nI will be following up more on the add-ins in future posts.\nCheckout the Add-in SSD365VSAddIn",

In the next blog I will explain some tricks to solve issues on the disk space. Look at the next example, we use a disk of 32GB and need 20 of them so we have 640 GB of disk space.\n\n\n\n\nOf course, check the prices: Pricing – Managed Disks | Microsoft Azure.\nBesides the disk size I also use DS13 V2, so I can upgrade to Managed Disks: Performance tuning development VM (Virtual Machine) – Kaya Consulting (kaya-consulting.com)\nWhy not 10 * 64 GB or 5 * 128 GB? It is all about IOPS!\nLater, in Azure it will look like below.\n\n\n\n\nWhen we look at the VM with Disk Management we see a striped disk that has partitions for database and ‘A…",

Finally run the next 3 commands.\nAXUpdateInstaller.exe generate -runbookid=”runbook” -topologyfile=”DefaultTopologyData.xml” -servicemodelfile=”DefaultServiceModelData.xml” -runbookfile=”runbook.xml”\nAXUpdateInstaller.exe import -runbookfile=”runbook.xml”\nAXUpdateInstaller.exe execute -runbookid=”runbook”\nMost of the time you get an error telling you the runbook is empty, that’s correct look at the file DefaultTopologyData.xml\n\nYou just must add the xml that is shown below\n<string>AOSService</string>\nSo, on the end the file will look like\n\nThe post Dynamics 365 LCS Tricks – mass install packages appeared first on Kaya Consulting.",
