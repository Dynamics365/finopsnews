This gives companies the ability to better and faster determine whether additional inventory is needed within a picking zone. The setup for the new feature is very similar to location-based replenishment. As new replenishment template is created for min/max replenishment, the user can simply specify whether the threshold should be evaluated per Location or per Zone. In case of zones, specific zones are then added to the Zone selection query and those will be evaluated by the newly created replenishment template when processed. Just like location-based min/max replenishment, the zone-based min/max replenishment is based on setting up a minimum threshold of inventory that triggers the creation of replenishment work order for selected items and item variants. In return, replenishment will be created for quantity that increases inventory up to the desired zone maximum threshold.",

On enabling this feature, this parallel processing will be activated and task configurations will be created for all warehouses from all legal entities that have \"Use warehouse management processes\" enabled. Each task configuration includes a setting that lets you define the number of tasks that will run simultaneously (which is equivalent to the number of parallel processes). Roughly, the time used on the allocate-wave step (which is typically 30% to 60% of the total processing time) is reduced by a factor equivalent to the number of tasks. It’s also possible to define the batch group that will be assigned to process these tasks. When this feature is enabled, all legal entities will process waves in batches and \"Wait for lock\" will be set to a default value of 60,000 ms if it was previously set to 0 ms. Other than this, the existing task and wave processing configurations will be kept for all warehouses that are already configured to process waves in batches, and for all warehouses that are already configured to use the allocateWave method in parallel. After enabling this feature, all new legal entities will be configured by default to process waves in batches, \"Wait for lock\" will be set to a default value of 60,000 ms, and all new warehouses with \"Use warehouse management processes\" enabled will have the allocateWave method configured to run in parallel by default.

This post will cover how to setup Git for use with 1 package.\nTo learn out to create a Git repo in Azure DevOps, please refer to MSFT documentation. To learn how to create a repo on Github, please refer to GitHub documentation.\nUsing Azure DevOps\nIn your dev VM, open Visual Studio then open Team Explorer. Click on Manage Connections then Connect to a project. \n\nNext, select your repo and place it in your PackagesLocalDirectory. K drive on cloud hosted machines and C on VHDs. \n\nWait for it to clone and, that's it. Refresh your models like usual and you can develop against 1 package using Git in Azure DevOps. This is what the sync'd directory will look like. \n\nUsing GitHub\nIn your dev VM, open Visual Studio then open Team Explorer. Click on Manage Connections then click Clone \n\nLog into GitHub then select your repo making sure to change the local path to include your PackagesLocalDirectory path.\n\nClick clone and wait. That's it. Your repo folder will look like this:\n\nCallout: If using VHD, drive will be the C drive rather than K drive.\nConclusion\nVery straight forward process. However, when using this style of package manage, you will only ever be allowed 1 package. You can add as many models as you like but you'll only ever have 1 package. This includes ISV packages as well including binary or source packages. I recommend this style of management for personal projects or something you'll be sharing on GitHub. I wouldn't recommend this approach for use on an implementation project.\n \n\n\n\n\nView the discussion thread.\n\n\n\nReported:",

Let's review.\nThe process to get Git working with F&O can be a little involved and it may not make sense the first time. The issue we're presented with is that Git assumes you are starting with nothing - a directory that doesn't exist. When you fetch source code - clone it - Git wants you to clone it into a directory that doesn't exist yet. Our PackagesLocalDirectory very much so already exists. So, we have to help Git by moving in pieces of the repo into the directory then get everything back in working order. There are a few different ways to do this: The Hard Way, the easier way, and the easiest way.\n \nThe Hard Way\nWe'll be using https://github.com/…",

          "description": "what is a pull request? how do they work? what do they signify?\nCreate a Pull Request (PR)\nThe code is done but not the work. The developer still has to singal that his work is complete. We'll want to create a Pull Request or PR for short. There are 2 ways to do this. The first is in VS, which will just redirect you to Azure DevOps. The second is Azure DevOps. In VS, it can be found here:\n\nIn Azure DevOps, go to Repors, select your repo, select your branch then click \"create a pull request\".\n\nInside the PR, you can add some details for the PR. Additionally, reviewers and actions can be configured inside DevOps.\n\nNotice you can select what you are creating a PR into. You can set a reviewer or additional reviewer if you'd like. Also notice that the PR is automagically associated with out bug work item. Let's create the PR.\n\nAs you can see, it merged successfully on its own and now we, or the approver, can approve and complete. Typically we wouldn't approve our own PRs. We'll see this when we complete.\n\nWe'll have an option for the merge type, if we want to use something different. Additionally, we have \"complete associate work items after merging\" checked as well as \"delete bug200 after merging\". This will resolve the bug setting it's status to done and deleting the branch we created for the work item called \"bug200\". Next, click \"Complete merge\". This is what the bug work item looks like after completing the PR:\n\nThe work item's status is \"Done\". Also note the links section. We can see that we had a commit and PR. However, the link to branch is now gone because the branch itself is gone.\nConclusion\nBecause Git Branches allow us to pull everything up, rather the push specific changesets like in TFVC, we can more easily keep track of what is where. As a for instance, until bug 200's work gets a completed PR, I know it's only in the branch for that work item.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \nBlog Main Tag: \nGit",

A model is a design-time concept, for example, a warehouse management model or a project accounting model. A model always belongs to a package. A package is a deployment and compilation unit of one or more models. It includes model metadata, binaries, and other associated resources. One or more packages can be packaged into a deploy…",

The application objects in the standard application can never be deleted.\nThe bottom layer would be the SYS layer, which is where the standard application code resides and is accessible only to Microsoft.

          "description": "Union query may be a very efficient and useful option when you need to fetch similar data fields from different tables. A good example of this may be the case when you to gather information about project related transactions as they can be of different types, like, expenses, fees, items, etc. \nSay, we need to render some report collecting all these different types of transaction that can be posted against a given project and group them by a given financial dimension value in Project group. Let's see how Union query can help us.\nIn order to better understand the goal, you can take a look to the standard form ProjInvoiceJournal which perfectly explains how all these table relate to each other. \n\nMost of them contain the same set of fields, and we simply need to get some of them into one view to populate by the report data provider.\nSo, at the first step, let's create all necessary queries for the source Project transaction related tables. Pick up the first and create a simple query as depicted. \n\n\n\nThen create a view based on this query. \n\nThen pick up the next and do the same.\n\n\nComplete these two steps for all necessary transaction types.\nNow you can create a Union query and add all your views together as they have the same set of fields.\n\n\nIf you need to distinguish them later who is who, say, in computed column methods, you can use  unionAllBranchId field, but this is out of the current focus.\n\nFinally you can elaborate it by adding a new view based on the latter with a simple SUM aggregation for Amount field.\n\n\nBasically, you achieve your goal with no coding.\nI am not going into details about the whole project, which you can get by this URL https://github.com/wojzeh/tmxProjectSalesPerSegment. Ping me, if you have any questions.\n\n\nRelated topics: \nComputed column for union values from multiple outer joined data sources in view",

Either to process it manually or to run some analysis on it (Or whatever reason you fancy). Unfortunately Visual studio only allows you to copy one result at a time from that window which doesnt make it very friendly. I had over 600 results  \nBring in AutoHotKey ! This is an extremely powerful scripting language. It runs off keyboard shortcuts, so you can run this from where your cursor is pointed at.\nFor my scenario, i managed to make it run with Ctrl + j and it goes through all the lines so quickly that VS doesnt skip to the source reference file.\nOnce installed, run it in the same context as Visual studio i.e.  is VS is running as an administrator then run the script as an administrator as well (So that VS doesnt capture the hotkeys and keep it to itself)\nhttps://github.com/shashisadasivan/MyScripts/blob/master/Misc/Visual%20Studio/VSCopySymbolResult.ahk\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n  \n \n\n\n \n\n View this post on Instagram\n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nA post shared by Zia (@zia.the.dog)",

          "description": "Something happened while I wasn't looking and now we have a clearer sequencing of Credit management Blocking rules. This has been a much-needed change, and I am happy to report on it!\nSequencing of Blocking Rules\n\n\nIn the past, Blocking rules in Credit management have all run, regardless of what happened on another Blocking rule. \nThis could cause frustration if a company wanted to stop processing once specific criteria had been met. \nAs of version 10.0.21, you may have noticed some new options within the Blocking rules form. \nWhen setting up Blocking rules, there is a new column within all Blocking rules labeled \"Release sales order.\" This can only be enabled on an Exclusion rule type.\n\n\nWhat this \"Release sales order\" toggle does, is it allows for an Exclusion rule to bypass all other Blocking rules and process the Sales order if it meets the Exclusion criteria. \nTypically, Blocking rules get processed before Exclusion rules, and an Exclusion rule on the same level as the Blocking rule will not exclude that Blocking rule. This is the exception to that rule. \n\n\nNew Sequence of Blocking Rules\n\n\nExclusion rule with Release Sales order checked\nBlocking rules (Run in Table, Group, then All sequence)\nExclusion rules (Run in Table, Group, then All sequence)\n\n\nHaving rules in place surrounding how Blocking rules are run is a massive improvement.

One of which is the following parameter: \nBypass inventory reservations\n\n\n\n\nA new parameter has appeared called Bypass inventory reservations, but what does it mean?\n\n\n\n\nRelease to Warehouse Credit Management Hold\n\n\nThere have been some observations made that when using the Release to warehouse Credit management checkpoint, the Sales order gets stuck in an infinite loop of going back on Credit hold after being released. This is occurring even if the order is Released to warehouse within the grace days defined. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Release to warehouse Credit management checkpoint in Credit and collections parameters\n\n\n\nMicrosoft has quietly released a fix for this in version 10.0.19 that is called Bypass inventory reservations. When this is enabled in the Credit and collections parameters, it will disregard inventory reservations when checking credit management blocking rules. Likewise, it will enable checkpoint grace periods regardless of inventory reservation quantity. \n\n\n\n\n\nEnable the Bypass inventory reservations parameter to avoid the Release to warehouse credit hold loop!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has been a lifesaver for people who have found themselves stuck in an endless loop of Credit management holds when they try to release their Sales order from Credit hold then try to Release to warehouse!",
