1
2
3
4
5
6



InventorySiteOnHandEntity
InventorySiteOnHandV2Entity
InventWarehouseInventoryStatusOnHandEntity
InventWarehouseInventoryStatusOnHandV2Entity
InventWarehouseOnHandEntity
InventWarehouseOnHandV2Entity





You can extend the ententies by adding new fields to tables and entities.
After you add fields to tables that are used by the inventSiteOnHandView view, you must sync the engine so that the extensions are correctly recognized.
Extend the InventSiteOnHandView view by adding the extension field.
Extend the InventSiteOnHandAggregatedView view with the extension fields.
Extend the InventSiteOnHandAggregatedViewBuilder viewBuilder class by modifying the getExtensionFields() method. In this way, you map old view fields to new view fields when viewBuilder synchronization is run.
For example, you’ve added the following four fields to the InventTable table through extension:
• Custom field 1
• Custom field 2
• Custom field 3
• Custom field 4
In the case, you must modify the getExtensionFields() method in the following way.]]></summary>

In D365 FO development you can directly input the labels, titles, or captions of any user interface, But in Standard project development, we need labels for displaying captions or titles in our user interface. The best practical method to achieve this goal is to use a label file. This label file contains a list of label IDs and related labels which are to be displayed on the user interfaces. You can call the label IDs to the user interfaces where you want to display the label. So, after creating a label file you must need to input a Label ID, a Label that is to be displayed on the user interfaces.
In this article, I will show you how to create a label file and how to use the created label file to display texts or titles on the user interfaces.

Enabling Users after a database refresh is a pain. Let's automate that away.
Re-enabling users in UAT after a data refresh from PROD can be annoying, especially if  you have to be granted access to the environment administrator's account. Let's work through one way of creating a pipeline in Azure DevOps to re-enable a list of users using D365.FO Tools, PowerShell and a few OData tricks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When selling subscriptions, memberships, or prepaid investments, companies often receive large sums of money upfront from their customers and cannot recognize that revenue immediately. This can cause accounting and cashflow issues if the money was immediately available as revenue all at once. Therefore, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance offers Revenue and expense deferrals as part of their new Subscription billing offerings. Revenue deferral allows the revenue to enter a deferred account and be recognized on a schedule to be defined by the accounting team. Let's discuss how to set this up.


Deferral Defaults
The first step is to set up Deferral defaults. This section can be found in Subscription billing > Revenue and expense deferrals > Setup > Deferral defaults.

        <updated>2022-10-10T10:17:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When setting up Subscription billing, there are two options for setting up the Recurring contract billing Invoice transaction type - Sales order or Free text invoice. 


Parameters
Within the Recurring contract billing parameters, you can specify which Invoice transaction type you'd like the Recurring contract billing to be. This will be the default whenever you create a new Recurring billing contract unless you modify it at the header level. 




Invoice transaction type setting in the Recurring contract billing parameters

So, what should you choose? 


Free text invoice
The benefits of using Free text invoice include:



No need for items, just type in the description
Can set the pricing to whatever you want (automatically defaults the line to Flat pricing method)
Specify Main account per line, or set up in Deferral defaults



The drawbacks of using Free text invoice include:



Cannot use trade agreements for pricing, as there are no items




Sales order
The benefits of using Sales order include:



Flexibility with pricing
Can use Tier and Flat tier pricing methods using trade agreements
Can automatically set deferrals on specific items and item groups that cannot be done at the Free text invoice level




The drawbacks of using Sales order include:



You have to set up items (some people find this tedious 😉)



Conclusion
If you have a simple, straightforward approach to billing subscriptions and don't mind a little bit of manual entry, then the Free text invoice is a clear winner. 


If you have complex pricing, prefer to use items, and want to set it and forget it, Sales order invoice is the clear winner for you!]]></summary>

In this blog post, I will dive into the Pricing methods that are available to add into our Billing schedule lines.
When setting up Billing schedules within the Subscription billing module for your Customers, there are four Pricing methods that a user can employ. 


Standard
Flat

Flat Tier


The methodology behind a couple of these pricing methods can be a bit confusing, so I am here to help de-mystify them for you!

In my example, I have a Released product (item) called Service. The Base sales price on the Released product is $500.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When signing up for a subscription, there are often different methodologies of how to pay for that subscription. Similarly, companies require different methodologies for billing. For example, some companies bill for their services at a flat rate per period. Others may operate on a usage basis, such as $x.xx per hour used. Lastly, some billing occurs as a fixed amount that gets billed when the goods/services are fully consumed.

The Subscription billing module in Dynamics 365 for Finance offers the flexibility to bill using these different methodologies. There are different Item Types and Pricing methodologies that can be used, and I am going to start breaking them down in this blog post for you today!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations, the layer system is used to manage application components in a predefined order. USR layer is the highest layer and SYS is the lowest layer. The purpose of layers is to give developers the option to modify Microsoft's code but only in one of the layers that the developer has access to.



The following table shows all layers and associated usage:


USR - The user layer is for user modifications, such as reports. 
CUS - The customer layer is for modifications that are specific to a company. 
VAR - Value Added Resellers (VAR) can make modifications or new developments to the VAR layer as specified by the customers or as a strategy for creating an industry-specific solution. 
ISV - When an Independent Software Vendor (ISV) creates its own solution, its modifications are saved in the ISV layer. 
SLN - The solution layer is used by distributors to implement vertical partner solutions. 
FPK - The FPK layer is an application object patch layer reserved by Microsoft for future patching or other updates.
GLS - When the application is modified to match country or region-specific legal demands, these modifications are saved in the GLS layer.
SYS - The standard application is implemented at the lowest level, the SYS layer. The application objects in the standard application can never be deleted.
The bottom layer would be the SYS layer, which is where the standard application code resides and is accessible only to Microsoft. Other layers like ISV (Independent Software Vendor) and VAR (Value Added Reseller) can be accessed by providing keys provided by Microsoft for each layer except USR (User) which does not need a key.]]></summary>

Development environments can be hosted locally or on Microsoft Azure. The build process, X++ compilation, and generation of cross-reference information typically run satisfactorily on machines with 16 GB of memory and two CPU cores. The compiler uses available resources, so more RAM and more cores will speed up compilation, especially if there is contention for resources from other concurrent processes. If you run concurrent processes, we recommend 24 GB of memory with four cores. A minimum of two CPU cores is recommended because the developer environment contains many components running simultaneously.

Check spellings - especially on data that is validated by the system (Address/city names, Dropdown values, etc)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Engineering and construction projects are mostly offered at a fixed price and almost every time require a down payment from the client. In Dynamics 365 for Finance, this is reflected by a Fixed-price project. Our accountants wish to book the advance payment invoice in the Balance sheet (Liability) and the partial or final invoice in the Profit & Loss section (Turnover). Yet in the case of a Fixed fee project, there is no difference between down, partial and final payments in standard Dynamics 365 for Finance: everything is a milestone with a certain amount. We suggest creating a special VAT group to control the Advance payment milestone ledger integration.

2. Is this feature available for retail cash and carry, sales order/ customer orders and back-office sales order invoices?
Some details about the feature: 
Electronic Invoicing service – Saudi Arabia e-invoice integration - Dynamics 365 Release Plan | Microsoft Doc

E-invoicing integration for Retail for Saudi Arabia is not yet available. See the following release plan for more details:

Optical Character Recognition. This is used to process documentation such as receipts and invoices by using Azure Cognitive Services to "read" the documentation and import the data into the system, cutting down on manual system entry.

Set up Payment method with the Operation name ‘Pay credit memo’ and associate appropriate Posting accounts in it
Retail and commerce/Channels/Retail stores/All retail stores/select the store HOUSTON/Tab Set up/Payment methods/in our case it is called Voucher: 
Issue Credit Memo
Go to MPOS/Show journal/select sale transaction/ Select Return transaction/Return/select Products/Return/select Reason for return/OK.
Go to Actions/Transaction options/Issue credit memo:
Credit memo will be issued and transaction will be posted.
Now we can check if credit memo has been issued
Retail and commerce/Channels/Retail stores/Credit memos:
Credit memo is issued with the number 1.
Apply Credit memo
Enter Sales Transaction in MPOS and then pay it using the Payment method ‘Voucher’ (which has an Operation name ‘Pay credit memo’):
Enter Credit memo number 1 (the number we see in step 3):
Click Check amount, we see Available amount:
Click the button on bottom ‘Tender Payment’:
Now we can check if Credit memo has been applied
Retail and commerce/Channels/Retail stores/Credit memos:
You will notice that Applied check box is now marked, Applied amount and Applied date are filled in.
 
NOTE:
If you have Partial payment scenario, e.g. 1 credit memo $100. Buy items worth $40, how to use the balance amount $60?
 The system issues a new credit memo for the remaining balance automatically. 
If credit memos are only partially redeemed, the system issues a new credit memo for the new balance. The new credit memo has a new number. A credit memo can be used only one time, and the system keeps a record of all the numbers that are used. The record can be viewed on the Credit memo table page. A customer can't redeem more than the value of the credit memo.]]></summary>

She was using this feature often and everything was working. But now when she clicks "Sign in", it seems to runs for a little bit and then back to the below screen with the message "Not authenticated" at the bottom.



We tried different ways to tackle this issue but below is what eventually worked.

In the Excel add-in, click the gear button


Change the server URL to connect to another environment (e.g. a Tier 2 UAT environment)


Repeat #2 but change the server URL back to the Production environment
Just like magic, now the add-in connects without a hitch

Technology is just wonderful, isn't it?

Dialogs are commonly used for small user tasks, such as filling the input values for generating a report, and presenting only the most important fields to the user when creating a new record etc. Since dialogues are used for small tasks, which is not commonly used for making complex forms, It also should not open a secondary window that requires user interaction. All user interaction should be carried out within the dialog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NSF, or Non-sufficient funds, are payments that have been received that are rejected by the bank as the account tied to the payment does not have sufficient funds to be paid out. These are often referred to as "bounced checks." This blog will detail how to set up and utilize the NSF functionality in Dynamics 365 for Finance to reverse the payment and mark it as NSF.






Setup - Bank Account
There is some preliminary setup that needs to be done on the bank account for NSF functionality to work. Navigate to Cash and bank management > Bank accounts > Bank accounts. Open the Bank account where you receive customer payments.
There, in the Payment management FastTab, you can mark a specific charges group and the name of the payment journal type you want to use for NSF payment reversals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When importing Workers into Dynamics 365 Human Resources (now in D365FO), you populate the Worker data entity with as much information as possible. Then, start the import using Data management and after the import is complete, you check Human resources > Workers > Workers, and there are no records to be found. The import says it was successful, so where did the worker records go?
If you look around, you will find them in the Workers without employment filtered view (Human resources > Workers > Workers without employment.) 





Great, the records made it into the system, but I don't want to touch each record and add employment dates. How do we use the Data management functionality to add "employment" to these worker records?


Employment V2 Data Entity


A data entity called Employment V2 allows you to update the Workers' employment through Data management instead of old-fashioned manual entry. The mapping for the Employment V2 Data entity looks like this:




The fields within the mapping of the Employment V2 data entity include: 


CalendarID
DimensionDisplayValue
EmploymentEndDate
EmploymentStartDate
LegalEntityID
PersonnelNumber
RegulatoryEstablishmentID
WorkerType



Depending on your setup, the data within the Employment V2 data entity can be as simple as this screenshot. 



Once the Employment V2 data entity is imported, the Worker records will become active in the Human resources > Workers > Workers view in the Dynamics 365 Human Resources module.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something happened while I wasn't looking and now we have a clearer sequencing of Credit management Blocking rules. This has been a much-needed change, and I am happy to report on it!
Sequencing of Blocking Rules


In the past, Blocking rules in Credit management have all run, regardless of what happened on another Blocking rule. 
This could cause frustration if a company wanted to stop processing once specific criteria had been met. 
As of version 10.0.21, you may have noticed some new options within the Blocking rules form. 
When setting up Blocking rules, there is a new column within all Blocking rules labeled "Release sales order." This can only be enabled on an Exclusion rule type.


What this "Release sales order" toggle does, is it allows for an Exclusion rule to bypass all other Blocking rules and process the Sales order if it meets the Exclusion criteria. 
Typically, Blocking rules get processed before Exclusion rules, and an Exclusion rule on the same level as the Blocking rule will not exclude that Blocking rule. This is the exception to that rule. 


New Sequence of Blocking Rules


Exclusion rule with Release Sales order checked
Blocking rules (Run in Table, Group, then All sequence)
Exclusion rules (Run in Table, Group, then All sequence)


Having rules in place surrounding how Blocking rules are run is a massive improvement. Here is the link to the documentation within Microsoft Docs: Credit holds for sales orders - Finance | Dynamics 365 | Microsoft Docs]]></summary>

GitHub is also an option you could pursue when moving to Git. GitHub has a lot of new features and offerings that Azure DevOps does not have. However, there is basically no documentation from MSFT on how to configure builds and various other automation options in GitHub. I'm sure it's possible but there will be a fair amount of guess work. Getting your pipelines fully converted to YAML will be the first step in making the transition to GitHub.
Community (Free)
I use GitHub to host all of my community projects which is great for that. I can share the code and anyone can pick it up and use it as they see fit. Private repos are now also an option.

Developing in VS with Git is easy but I wanted to call out a few changes. First, you don't need to manually add items to your repo. Your repo will have a .gitingore file that says what can be committed - and what can't. If your .gitIgnore file doesn't specifically ignore it, it will automatically be added. Also, your project folder will need to be in the package directory more than likely (or somewhere under source control in the same repo as your code). If you're using the more than 1 package approach, it can be shared if you like. Additionally, there is no source control explorer.

Unlike TFVC, branches in Git are typically short lived when it comes to development. In TFVC you may have a branch for each developer or a branch for development in general, another for test then a release branch. In Git, we will be using branches differently. We'll get a change request as a work item in DevOps, review it, create a branch, assign to a developer to do the work plus commit it, optional build automation may occur, next a pull request, or PR, with a review and then the changes are accepted into the parent branch. We'll walk through this in specific details. In this example, we'll be using a bug but you can replace "bug" with "Feature", "Product Backlog Item", "Change Request", "Customization", "Enhancement", or any other word …]]></summary>

There are 2 options when looking at Git for managing your X++ code. The main driver for which option you select is if you will only ever have 1 package in your code base or more than 1. This include any ISVs or any other item that will have a code footprint anywhere in F&O. To learn more about packages, please see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/dev-tools/models. 
1 Package as a Branch
This option is the simplest. You would have 1 package as a branch. A good example of this is this GitHub project. It's a small package that add a features, it only depends on OOTB F&O packages and models and has no other dependencies not does anything else depend on it. It doesn't get any more simple than this.

Using Git with 1 Package
When using Git for F&O, there are 2 basic flavors of using it; with 1 package or more than 1 package. This post will cover how to setup Git for use with 1 package.
To learn out to create a Git repo in Azure DevOps, please refer to MSFT documentation. To learn how to create a repo on Github, please refer to GitHub documentation.
Using Azure DevOps
In your dev VM, open Visual Studio then open Team Explorer. Click on Manage Connections then Connect to a project. 

Next, select your repo and place it in your PackagesLocalDirectory. K drive on cloud hosted machines and C on VHDs. 

Wait for it to clone and, that's it. Refresh your models like usual and you can develop against 1 package using Git in Azure DevOps. This is what the sync'd directory will look like. 

Using GitHub
In your dev VM, open Visual Studio then open Team Explorer. Click on Manage Connections then click Clone 

Log into GitHub then select your repo making sure to change the local path to include your PackagesLocalDirectory path.

Click clone and wait. That's it. Your repo folder will look like this:

Callout: If using VHD, drive will be the C drive rather than K drive.
Conclusion
Very straight forward process. However, when using this style of package manage, you will only ever be allowed 1 package. You can add as many models as you like but you'll only ever have 1 package. This includes ISV packages as well including binary or source packages. I recommend this style of management for personal projects or something you'll be sharing on GitHub. I wouldn't recommend this approach for use on an implementation project.

You
If you're reading this, I assume you're interested in getting away from TFVC for some reason, you're a technically focused individual, and you understand the differences between using Git and TFVC. 
Your Team
Your team should also be aware of what it takes to be successful in order to make a switch from TFVC to Git. They may need some additional training in order to get the the most out of Git. Developing and delivering with Git is a different exper…]]></summary>

Source Control      

Want to use Git with more than 1 Package? Let's review.
The process to get Git working with F&O can be a little involved and it may not make sense the first time. The issue we're presented with is that Git assumes you are starting with nothing - a directory that doesn't exist. When you fetch source code - clone it - Git wants you to clone it into a directory that doesn't exist yet. Our PackagesLocalDirectory very much so already exists. So, we have to help Git by moving in pieces of the repo into the directory then get everything back in working order. There are a few different ways to do this: The Hard Way, the easier way, and the easiest way.
 
The Hard Way

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[what is a pull request? how do they work? what do they signify?
Create a Pull Request (PR)
The code is done but not the work. The developer still has to singal that his work is complete. We'll want to create a Pull Request or PR for short. There are 2 ways to do this. The first is in VS, which will just redirect you to Azure DevOps. The second is Azure DevOps. In VS, it can be found here:

In Azure DevOps, go to Repors, select your repo, select your branch then click "create a pull request".

Inside the PR, you can add some details for the PR. Additionally, reviewers and actions can be configured inside DevOps.

Notice you can select what you are creating a PR into. You can set a reviewer or additional reviewer if you'd like. Also notice that the PR is automagically associated with out bug work item. Let's create the PR.

As you can see, it merged successfully on its own and now we, or the approver, can approve and complete. Typically we wouldn't approve our own PRs. We'll see this when we complete.

We'll have an option for the merge type, if we want to use something different. Additionally, we have "complete associate work items after merging" checked as well as "delete bug200 after merging". This will resolve the bug setting it's status to done and deleting the branch we created for the work item called "bug200". Next, click "Complete merge". This is what the bug work item looks like after completing the PR:

The work item's status is "Done". Also note the links section. We can see that we had a commit and PR. However, the link to branch is now gone because the branch itself is gone.
Conclusion
Because Git Branches allow us to pull everything up, rather the push specific changesets like in TFVC, we can more easily keep track of what is where. As a for instance, until bug 200's work gets a completed PR, I know it's only in the branch for that work item.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some big changes were made to Credit management in recent versions that need to be addressed. One of which is the following parameter: 
Bypass inventory reservations




A new parameter has appeared called Bypass inventory reservations, but what does it mean?




Release to Warehouse Credit Management Hold


There have been some observations made that when using the Release to warehouse Credit management checkpoint, the Sales order gets stuck in an infinite loop of going back on Credit hold after being released. This is occurring even if the order is Released to warehouse within the grace days defined. 





The Release to warehouse Credit management checkpoint in Credit and collections parameters



Microsoft has quietly released a fix for this in version 10.0.19 that is called Bypass inventory reservations. When this is enabled in the Credit and collections parameters, it will disregard inventory reservations when checking credit management blocking rules. Likewise, it will enable checkpoint grace periods regardless of inventory reservation quantity. 





Enable the Bypass inventory reservations parameter to avoid the Release to warehouse credit hold loop!





This has been a lifesaver for people who have found themselves stuck in an endless loop of Credit management holds when they try to release their Sales order from Credit hold then try to Release to warehouse!]]></summary>

Ik heb al heel wat datamigraties gedaan, maar om eerlijk te zijn houd ik niet van de volledige data- en codemigratie.
Dus ja, ik doe de codemigratie, maar de gemigreerde code is vanuit mijn oogpunt slechts een library met mogelijke herbruikbare oplossingen.

We maken de nieuwe masterdata, en als deze taak is voltooid, moet je migreren naar de volgende topics. De truc is dat je ook de customizations van bovenstaande topics moet toevoegen op de data-entiteiten. Deze truc werkt zelfs voor AX 2009. Dus, hier is een overzicht van alles wat geëxporteerd moet worden.

After posting a write-up adjustment to a fixed asset that applies straight-line service life, the system will extended depreciation periods to keep depreciation expenses consistent across the service life of the asset. When applying this type of adjustment, there’s a chance that depreciation amount in the last period differ from the amounts in the preceding periods.]]></summary>

This feature enables all users who work with waves to inspect the batch jobs and related tasks associated with any wave. This is especially useful for troubleshooting a wave that has failed. Without this feature, only administrators will typically have access to batch job details. The feature adds a new page called 'Wave batch job details', which can be made available to non-admin users and which provides a read-only view of batch jobs and related tasks. Users can open this page by selecting a wave on any of several different wave pages and then selecting the appropriate option from the Action Pane.]]></summary>

This functionality allows for warehouse managers to plan the picking locations in the warehouse intelligently prior to releasing order to the warehouse and creating picking work. Slotting allows users to gather consolidate demand by item and unit of measure from orders, in status either ordered, reserved, or release. Once demand has been generated, it can be located to locations that will be used for picking based on quantity, unit, physical dimensions, fixed locations, etc. Once the slot plan has been established, replenishment work can be created to bring the appropriate amount of inventory to each location.]]></summary>

Zone based replenishment is a feature which utilizes min/max replenishment strategy but evaluates entire warehouse zones, if set, instead of just individual locations. This gives companies the ability to better and faster determine whether additional inventory is needed within a picking zone. The setup for the new feature is very similar to location-based replenishment. As new replenishment template is created for min/max replenishment, the user can simply specify whether the threshold should be evaluated per Location or per Zone. In case of zones, specific zones are then added to the Zone selection query and those will be evaluated by the newly created replenishment template when processed. Just like location-based min/max replenishment, the zone-based min/max replenishment is based on setting up a minimum threshold of inventory that triggers the creation of replenishment work order for selected items and item variants. In return, replenishment will be created for quantity that increases inventory up to the desired zone maximum threshold.]]></summary>

This features gives you the option of running the allocateWave method for wave templates in parallel to improve wave processing performance. On enabling this feature, this parallel processing will be activated and task configurations will be created for all warehouses from all legal entities that have "Use warehouse management processes" enabled. Each task configuration includes a setting that lets you define the number of tasks that will run simultaneously (which is equivalent to the number of parallel processes). Roughly, the time used on the allocate-wave step (which is typically 30% to 60% of the total processing time) is reduced by a factor equivalent to the number of tasks. It’s also possible to define the batch group that will be assigned to process these tasks. When this feature is enabled, all legal entities will process waves in batches and "Wait for lock" will be set to a default value of 60,000 ms if it was previously set to 0 ms. Other than this, the existing task and wave processing configurations will be kept for all warehouses that are already configured to process waves in batches, and for all warehouses that are already configured to use the allocateWave method in parallel. After enabling this feature, all new legal entities will be configured by default to process waves in batches, "Wait for lock" will be set to a default value of 60,000 ms, and all new warehouses with "Use warehouse management processes" enabled will have the allocateWave method configured to run in parallel by default. Existing warehouses for which you change "Use warehouse management processes" from "no" to "yes" will also run this method in parallel by default.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please see Documentation on the Edit and Audit feature, which includes installing the Microsoft Dynamics Office Add In
Edit and audit cash and carry and cash management transactions - Commerce | Dynamics 365 | Microsoft Learn

In this example, I have Tricklefeed enabled and the transactions are in a closed fiscal period.
I have used this process to update invalid Customer accounts and to Void transactions.

First Calculate Transactional statement for a period that is closed.
When in the Statement form, Select Office icon in the upper right corner


Select Edit cash and carry transactions

Click Download


Save the file and open
Click Enable editing

You may get a message to “Trust this add-in”
Sign in
Data will refresh
Transaction tab
Validation Status = None
**Note:  Before you can edit a transaction, the Validation Status must be set to none and published
On the Excel file you can select all and fill down.
Publish

You can then edit the field you want to change
In this case I am changing the Business date to a date within the current period
 
Update the first transaction, then select all lines and Fill Down

Select Sales transaction worksheet and update business date
Select Payment transactions worksheet and update business date
Select Aggregation worksheet and update business date.
**Note: All worksheets that have the business date available should be updated or you will continue to receive errors on a closed fiscal period or Inventory is closed.  Don't forget the Aggregation worksheet.
 
Click Publish


Go back into the Retail Statement, select Revalidate Transactions to set the Validation Status back to Validated.

You may also need to go into Aggregated transactions and select Re-generate aggregation data.



You should be able to post the statement]]></summary>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1173808/can-i-copy-multiple-rows-from-the-visual-studio-find-symbol-results-window
Sometimes it is probably useful to copy all the data from the Symbol results window in Visual studio. Either to process it manually or to run some analysis on it (Or whatever reason you fancy). Unfortunately Visual studio only allows you to copy one result at a time from that window which doesnt make it very friendly. I had over 600 results  
Bring in AutoHotKey ! This is an extremely powerful scripting language. It runs off keyboard shortcuts, so you can run this from where your cursor is pointed at.
For my scenario, i managed to make it run with Ctrl + j and it goes through all the lines so quickly that VS doesnt skip to the source reference file.
Once installed, run it in the same context as Visual studio i.e.  is VS is running as an administrator then run the script as an administrator as well (So that VS doesnt capture the hotkeys and keep it to itself)

Hugo uses Markdown for its simple content format. However, there are a lot of things that Markdown doesn’t support well. You could use pure HTML to expand possibilities.
But this happens to be a bad idea. Everyone uses Markdown because it’s pure and simple to read even non-rendered. You should avoid HTML to keep it as simple as possible.
To avoid this limitations, Hugo created shortcodes.
A shortcode is a simple snippet that can generate reasonable HTML code and conforms to Markdown’s design philosophy.
Hugo ships with a set of predefined shortcodes that represent very common usage. These shortcodes are provided for author convenience and to keep your markdown content clean.

Note
        
Hugo extended version is necessary for style shortcode.
style is a shortcode to insert custom style in your post.
The style shortcode has two positional parameters.
The first one is the custom style content,
which supports nesting syntax in  SASS
and & referring to this parent HTML element.
And the second one is the tag name of the HTML element wrapping the content you want to change style, and whose default value is div.
Example style input:

Of course, check the prices: Pricing – Managed Disks | Microsoft Azure.
Besides the disk size I also use DS13 V2, so I can upgrade to Managed Disks: Performance tuning development VM (Virtual Machine) – Kaya Consulting (kaya-consulting.com)
Why not 10 * 64 GB or 5 * 128 GB? It is all about IOPS!

Although we do not recommend it, organizations can continue using Russian payroll capabilities with the knowledge that all regulatory updates and non-security hotfixes for Dynamics AX 2012 R3 will end on October 12, 2021, and security hotfixes will end on January 10, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To print Credit card information on the Customer Receipt, perform the following steps

Go to Retail and Commerce > Channel setup > POS setup > POS profile > Receipt profiles
Select the Receipt profile you are using (Default for me)
Select Customer’s credit card receipt (make a copy if you do not want to lose your Customer’s credit card receipt)
The Receipt format should be set to “Do not print”

Select Designer and log into the designer
 
In the Customer Credit Card Receipt, add the credit card fields you would like to print on the Customer receipt.  Delete all other fields.
Unfortunately, you can only delete fields one at a time in the Receipt designer.
**Note:  Card number partly hidden will display the last 4 digits of the credit card.
 
Save the Receipt format.
Select the Select format tab
 
Change the Receipt format to the Customer Receipt (Mine is 1) and click OK
 
Select the Footer of the Customer Receipt.  Pull the Card Tender Details into the Footer of the layout
 
Save the Customer Receipt and close the Designer
Run the 1090 (Register) job
In POS sell a transaction and print the receipt.
The fields that were added to the Customer Credit Card Receipt are printing based on the Card Tender Details field added to the Footer of the Customer Receipt.


Disclaimer:  If you have more than one Credit Card payment, this will only print the first card details.  You will have to customize and loop though all the payments on the transaction to get multiple credit card details to print.
Another option is to add EFT Message into the Header of the Credit Card Receipt

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ah, the good old capacity error. "Production order ***** could not be scheduled. Not enough capacity could be found."
There are a few main culprits for this error. 


1. Calendar
The majority of the time, this error is caused by a Calendar issue. The most likely fix is that you are out of time, or almost out of time on your calendar and need to create new working times. This often happens near the end of the year, when the calendar is filling up and does not carry over to the next year.




2. Route
Your resources on your Route may be incorrect. I have seen some operations on a route that have been created to produce 1 item per 100 hours. It was an honest mistake and likely got flip-flopped during item creation. When the new item got scheduled, it blew out capacity and the order erred with the "Production order ***** could not be scheduled. Not enough capacity could be found." error. 


Oops! Someone put these values in backward!





Production order could not be scheduled. Not enough capacity could be found.



3.Lead times
This one is a little more obscure. If you have an item with no routes specified, you can still receive this error! The error is likely coming from a lead time that has been set up on a component item on the BOM that has exceeded the Lead time in the Maximum job lead time field in the Production control parameters. 
If this is set to zero or anything less than a lead time on a component item, you will get the "Production order could not be scheduled. Not enough capacity could be found." 


Maximum job lead time field can impact capacity and generate the capacity error!


Likewise, you can set the Capacity scheduling time fence (days) on the Coverage group.


Capacity scheduling time fence (days) field on the Coverage group


Just ensure that the days you set are not exceeded by any lead times on any of your BOM component items, or this will trigger the "Production order could not be scheduled. Not enough capacity could be found." error.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the pain points in AX/F&O was that you could not set up batch processing for your Payment advice reports. 
In late 2019/early 2020, a new feature was added called "Enable batch processing for bank payment advice reports." 
The description reads as follows:

This feature lets you use batch processing for both the customer and vendor bank payment advice reports. To use this feature you must use BankPaymAdviceVendV2 and BankPaymAdviceCustV2 bank payment advice, and set them up as the customer and vendor report formats in print management.

How do we set this up and use this functionality? In our example today, we will look at this from an Accounts payable/Vendor perspective.

The first step is to enable the feature in the Feature management workspace.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When creating Automatic credit limits, you can create a set of rules that will take specific criteria into account while quickly and easily applying credit limits. Navigate to Credit and collections > Setup > Risk > Automatic credit limits to begin. 


Automatic Credit Limits
When defining Automatic credit limits, you will use the Scoring groups that were created for Risk scores. 




Definitions for Automatic credit limits


In the above example, Customers that are in the "High" Risk group, with Currency USD, who have been in business less than 5 years will be given a Credit limit of $5,000.
The following Customer meets the criteria specified, and when the Automatic credit limit rules are applied, will be assigned a $5,000 Credit limit. 


Customer FR-004 will have a credit limit of $5,000 automatically applied



Applying Automatic Credit Limits
Automatic credit limits get applied at the Credit limit adjustment journal. Navigate to Credit and collections > Credit limit adjustments. Create a new Credit limit adjustment journal. When the journal has been created, open the Lines and click Generate. From there, select Automatic credit limits to run and apply Automatic credit limits. 


Click Generate to create Automatic credit limits



Once complete, you should have new Credit limit adjustment journal lines that meet the criteria specified in the Automatic credit limit rules you created.

When you are ready, you can Post the journal and the new Credit limit will be applied to your Customer.]]></summary>

Parameters
Navigate to Credit and collections > Setup > Credit and collections parameters to TURN OFF the ability to edit the Credit limit field. That's right. There is a slider in the Credit limits section called Allow manual editing of credit limits. Set this to No.  




Set the Allow manual editing of credit limits Slider to No



This will "grey out" the Credit limit field on the Customer, making it uneditable. 


Credit limit is no longer able to be edited



Credit Limit Adjustment Journals
That's great! Now, how do we update a Customer's Credit limit? 
Navigate to Credit and collections > Credit limit adjustments to create a Credit limit adjustment journal. You can enter two types of journals here, a Credit limit adjustment or a Temporary credit limit adjustment. Once you determine the Credit limit that you would like to apply to a Customer or to a Customer credit group, you can Post the journal, keeping a historical record of the Customer's Credit limits.


Post the Credit limit adjustment journal


For additional approval and compliance functionality, there is a Credit limit workflow that can be enabled on the Credit limit journals as well.]]></summary>
