https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1173808/can-i-copy-multiple-rows-from-the-visual-studio-find-symbol-results-window
Sometimes it is probably useful to copy all the data from the Symbol results window in Visual studio. Either to process it manually or to run some analysis on it (Or whatever reason you fancy). Unfortunately Visual studio only allows you to copy one result at a time from that window which doesnt make it very friendly. I had over 600 results  
Bring in AutoHotKey ! This is an extremely powerful scripting language. It runs off keyboard shortcuts, so you can run this from where your cursor is pointed at.
For my scenario, i managed to make it run with Ctrl + j and it goes through all the lines so quickly that VS doesnt skip to the source reference file.
Once installed, run it in the same context as Visual studio i.e.  is VS is running as an administrator then run the script as an administrator as well (So that VS doesnt capture the hotkeys and keep it to itself)

Nowadays exporting and refreshing can also be triggered with the Database Movement API This can become extremely handy for daily automated backups of D365FO databases. How we do it? With DEVOPS release pipelines. The pipeline looks like this. The BACKUP TST is disabled because the API does not ‘yet’ support Tier 1 Databases.




Speeding up
Because we had to apply automated backups of D365FO databases at multiple customers. It became time consuming. So, we optimized it. All customer specific setting became Variables of the pipeline. Because customer specific Client ID, Client Secret, and password, are sensitive information we have hidden them. Be aware in case you unhide, the values are cleared.

Importing data will pretty much be done the same way using a similar zip file which includes the 2 xml files as well PackageHeader.xml and Manifest.xml . These files specify the mapping between the excel and staging table and the entity and name of the excel file.
So to keep it simple, follow the Previous post and export the entity, and download the zip file.
Then you can run a powershell script which will update the filename, copy them across to a folder and rename them.

Add your entities that you want to export.I will use the Re;eased product attachments entity for this.  Remember to check importable fields only at this stage. ( i will be using this template to import images later 

Hit export and download the package

Open the zipped file and and you will see 3 files and 1 folder
a. Manifest.xml
b. PackageHeader.xml
c. Release product document attachment.xlsx (This contains all the records with the file name in it.)
d. Resource folder – this contains the files (inside the folder of the entity name) without a type. You will need to match the file name against the value in the excel file under the column “AttachmentFileName”. you will need to change the name of the file and type in order to open it.]]></summary>

The idea for me to create the add-in was to reduce the number of keystrokes and especially moving forward and backwards between the AOT and the code editor.

The Add-in however only works from the Object designer instead of the AOT nodes, which is most of the times a good thing especially when you are searching for code via the code editor.
I will be following up more on the add-ins in future posts.

A typical metadata file (edmx) retrieved from https://<d365url>/data/$metadata will return a file of almost 17MB. Turn that into a c# file using the T4 templates and the C# source file is almost 64MB.
After spending some time trying to reduce the EDMX file to only the entities I require (and a lot of nagging by my friend) I created a way to remove the excess entities from here. Result is a smaller EDMX file, and a more lightweight .Net application for you.
Reference this Trimmed EDMX file in your T4 template
The project and instructions can be found at my Github project EDMXTrimmer: https://github.com/shashisadasivan/EDMXTrimmer

We had 2 scenarios at our customer site:
–        Barcode printing.
–        FollowMe printing.
Barcode printing
Barcode printing is not meant to be complex, but when printing to screen or printer, it did not work.  The reason was that the machine which generated the report must have the barcode font installed. When printing to screen a webpage is generated that contains the following content.

the process
We download the KB updates and apply them to a Local VM that is linked to VSTS.  Next we test and migrate it to the release branch on VSTS.  Lastly, we start the build process.

The artifacts that are published in VSTS can be downloaded and imported to the LCS asset library. From that point you distribute it to all applicable environments.
Error?
Last week, we did it all, but in LCS the KB number stood stuck on 167. I downloaded the KB again on my local VM, installed again, and there was no code change.  I verified my merge to the release branch and again, it was all fine.

As we inspect 6880717, we find that the file contains the changed source code and a Package Manifest xml file. This Package Manifest contains information about what is changed and the KB number.


  
This information of the package manifest is also stored in VSTS in the AxUpdate map. The filename is in above case is 6880717.xml.  But there is no information about KB number in it.
Good to know:
How do you know if you have this problem? In LCS on every environment there is a link called detail information.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deploying packages is a time-consuming thing. MS has improved the speed, but we partner can also help. This helping is by merging the packages. Good merged combinations are Binary updates and x++ updates, but your own code can also be combined with your customizations on your Retail (SDK) part.
Till now I was not able to merge ISV packages, so those must be deployed separately.  However, there is quick dirty trick for local VM. 

the tick
You must download the ISV packages and extract them all into the same map. Don’t bother messages like this file is already there, just override it.
On the end your ISV extracted content will look like this.

Next open the DOS prompt (just press file button in the file explorer and select DOS, your also directly on the right spot. Finally run the next 3 commands.
AXUpdateInstaller.exe generate -runbookid=”runbook” -topologyfile=”DefaultTopologyData.xml” -servicemodelfile=”DefaultServiceModelData.xml” -runbookfile=”runbook.xml”
AXUpdateInstaller.exe import -runbookfile=”runbook.xml”
AXUpdateInstaller.exe execute -runbookid=”runbook”
Most of the time you get an error telling you the runbook is empty, that’s correct look at the file DefaultTopologyData.xml

You just must add the xml that is shown below
<string>AOSService</string>
So, on the end the file will look like

        <updated>2016-04-14T02:48:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i had created a UI for the license generator.
To create a license in 2012 this was the command:
axutil genlicense /file:c:\licenses\MyLicense.txt /certificatepath:c:\certificates\MyCertificate.pfx /licenseCode:MyModule /customer:MyCustomer /serialnumber:1231232123 /password:MySecretPassword123 /expirationdate:12/30/2018 /usercount:5

However, having the password and certificate path information available wasnt exactly a good idea at that time (and probably is still relevant. Why would you want to distribute those two together no?)
So came the the License generator, with the password hard coded and everything else seemingly invisible to the person punching the licenses without having someone with knowledge of the axutil and more importantly
What is this black box ? and why cant I just click somewhere

Moving forward a few years later and opening up the code out, (yes the password has been taken out of the code). Its now stored as well, although not very secure, but enough to keep prying eyes out for a bit. (this means rooms for improvement)
The code is published at GitHub under AxLicenseGenerator (See the readme in that link)
Or you can Download Ax License Generator 1.1
There is lots more information there, or message me if you need more information.
Happy Licensing
License Generator v 1.1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of changes have taken place in the X++ language and to align it close to the C# model which is where we want to be. There is no longer any p-code compilation, everything is run from the CIL.
This my compilation of what has changed and some examples for them as well.
Editing Experience: Visual studio interface only. Finally a more structured way of viewing code.
Declare anywhere:  :star:
The var keyword: :star:
&amp;amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;amp;gt;
&amp;amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;amp;gt;var counter = 0;
var custTable = salesTable.custTable();

Static constructor and fields: Static member variables Static constructors: TypeNew
Macros: As i suspected, try avoiding these guys. Will be deprecated in later releases (my view) const (constant) and readonly: 
Field Access: :star:
Field access was only protected in Ax (no questions asked, and nothing else you can do about it)
Now: if you havent specified the access they are still protected, but you can specify public, or private
Access variables by reference:  :star:
:)
        this.Name = "Hello World!";
    }
}
class Access
{
    public AccessVariables()
    {
        var myVars = new MyVariables();
        myVars.Name = "Hello New world!"; // Name is accessed via the class object,no more Parm methods required;
    }
}

try / catch / Finally: :star:
using statement: :star:
Implement .Net Classes:
:) , so your X++ class can implement IDisposable
Extension Methods:
There are very similar to C# extensions, except the convention is to end the class with _Extension and not Extension
Declarative Eventing (Methods and objects):
Ax 2012 gave us the ability to add events to methods. This is still the same, i.e. events still exist, exept they are called declaratively (i.e. in code and no clicks).
Although, the way to access arguments is still not to my liking and even though it seperates code out a lot, any errors are at runtime only, which can be very “hard” to manage
Casting is standard now:

Moving a project to a different model causes Ax to move all the objects inside it to that model as well.
You could instead create a new project in the Model you want it and then drag all the objects into that. You will lose all the metadata of the project including timestamps.
Another way is to move just the object related to the Project to the right model.
For that use the following steps

Copy the Name of the Project
Find the ModelId you want to move it into. You can use Get-AxModel command for this. (this should be within the same Layer)
Open SQL and find the Element handle of the Project. Use the following command to do that
