This feature enables all users who work with waves to inspect the batch jobs and related tasks associated with any wave. This is especially useful for troubleshooting a wave that has failed. Without this feature, only administrators will typically have access to batch job details. The feature adds a new page called 'Wave batch job details', which can be made available to non-admin users and which provides a read-only view of batch jobs and related tasks. Users can open this page by selecting a wave on any of several different wave pages and then selecting the appropriate option from the Action Pane.]]></summary>

This feature allows warehouse managers to replenish picking locations based on demand from transfer orders that aren't yet released to the warehouse. It ensures that picking locations will include all the items needed for the transfer orders once they are released to warehouse. This feature requires that you also enable the "Warehouse slotting feature".]]></summary>

This functionality allows for warehouse managers to plan the picking locations in the warehouse intelligently prior to releasing order to the warehouse and creating picking work. Slotting allows users to gather consolidate demand by item and unit of measure from orders, in status either ordered, reserved, or release. Once demand has been generated, it can be located to locations that will be used for picking based on quantity, unit, physical dimensions, fixed locations, etc. Once the slot plan has been established, replenishment work can be created to bring the appropriate amount of inventory to each location.]]></summary>

Zone based replenishment is a feature which utilizes min/max replenishment strategy but evaluates entire warehouse zones, if set, instead of just individual locations. This gives companies the ability to better and faster determine whether additional inventory is needed within a picking zone. The setup for the new feature is very similar to location-based replenishment. As new replenishment template is created for min/max replenishment, the user can simply specify whether the threshold should be evaluated per Location or per Zone. In case of zones, specific zones are then added to the Zone selection query and those will be evaluated by the newly created replenishment template when processed. Just like location-based min/max replenishment, the zone-based min/max replenishment is based on setting up a minimum threshold of inventory that triggers the creation of replenishment work order for selected items and item variants. In return, replenishment will be created for quantity that increases inventory up to the desired zone maximum threshold.]]></summary>

This features gives you the option of running the allocateWave method for wave templates in parallel to improve wave processing performance. On enabling this feature, this parallel processing will be activated and task configurations will be created for all warehouses from all legal entities that have "Use warehouse management processes" enabled. Each task configuration includes a setting that lets you define the number of tasks that will run simultaneously (which is equivalent to the number of parallel processes). Roughly, the time used on the allocate-wave step (which is typically 30% to 60% of the total processing time) is reduced by a factor equivalent to the number of tasks. It‚Äôs also possible to define the batch group that will be assigned to process these tasks. When this feature is enabled, all legal entities will process waves in batches and "Wait for lock" will be set to a default value of 60,000 ms if it was previously set to 0 ms. Other than this, the existing task and wave processing configurations will be kept for all warehouses that are already configured to process waves in batches, and for all warehouses that are already configured to use the allocateWave method in parallel. After enabling this feature, all new legal entities will be configured by default to process waves in batches, "Wait for lock" will be set to a default value of 60,000 ms, and all new warehouses with "Use warehouse management processes" enabled will have the allocateWave method configured to run in parallel by default. Existing warehouses for which you change "Use warehouse management processes" from "no" to "yes" will also run this method in parallel by default.]]></summary>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1173808/can-i-copy-multiple-rows-from-the-visual-studio-find-symbol-results-window
Sometimes it is probably useful to copy all the data from the Symbol results window in Visual studio. Either to process it manually or to run some analysis on it (Or whatever reason you fancy). Unfortunately Visual studio only allows you to copy one result at a time from that window which doesnt make it very friendly. I had over 600 results  
Bring in AutoHotKey ! This is an extremely powerful scripting language. It runs off keyboard shortcuts, so you can run this from where your cursor is pointed at.
For my scenario, i managed to make it run with Ctrl + j and it goes through all the lines so quickly that VS doesnt skip to the source reference file.
Once installed, run it in the same context as Visual studio i.e.  is VS is running as an administrator then run the script as an administrator as well (So that VS doesnt capture the hotkeys and keep it to itself)

In the next blog I will explain some tricks to solve issues on the disk space. Look at the next example, we use a disk of 32GB and need 20 of them so we have 640 GB of disk space.




Of course, check the prices: Pricing ‚Äì Managed Disks | Microsoft Azure.
Besides the disk size I also use DS13 V2, so I can upgrade to Managed Disks: Performance tuning development VM (Virtual Machine) ‚Äì Kaya Consulting (kaya-consulting.com)

You can add actions by adding a method to the data entity and then decorating the method with specific attributes [SysODataActionAttribute]
I use this Odata actions mostly in automation job like after refreshing data from PROD to UAT, we need to enable users, assign company to users, enable batches ‚Ä¶
Or simply consume it in Power Automate.
1. Create an action to OData entity
You can create a new entity following this standard docs
or you can duplicate any standard entity. I created AutomationDataEntity. Right-click the enitity, select View code and add the code

Download the bacpac file from the LCS asset library
Import the bacpac file into a new database
Stop all services

Nowadays exporting and refreshing can also be triggered with the Database Movement API This can become extremely handy for daily automated backups of D365FO databases. How we do it? With DEVOPS release pipelines. The pipeline looks like this. The BACKUP TST is disabled because the API does not ‚Äòyet‚Äô support Tier 1 Databases.




Speeding up
Because we had to apply automated backups of D365FO databases at multiple customers. It became time consuming. So, we optimized it. All customer specific setting became Variables of the pipeline. Because customer specific Client ID, Client Secret, and password, are sensitive information we have hidden them. Be aware in case you unhide, the values are cleared.

Power Virtual Agents empowers teams to easily create powerful bots using a 
guided, no-code graphical interface without the need for data scientists or 
developers. Power Virtual Agents addresses many of the major issues with 
bot building in the industry today. It eliminates the gap between the 
subject matter experts and the development teams building the bots, and the 
long latency between teams recognizing an issue and updating the bot to 
address it. It removes the complexity of exposing teams to the nuances of 
conversational AI and the need to write complex code. And, it minimizes the 
IT effort required to deploy and maintain a custom conversational solution.

Importing data will pretty much be done the same way using a similar zip file which includes the 2 xml files as well PackageHeader.xml and Manifest.xml . These files specify the mapping between the excel and staging table and the entity and name of the excel file.
So to keep it simple, follow the Previous post and export the entity, and download the zip file.
Then you can run a powershell script which will update the filename, copy them across to a folder and rename them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Data management in Dynamics 365 Finance (and maybe operations) you can export images the same way you export other data. The images are exported as files, however,, they are stored in a GUID name and you have to link this on. 
Create an Export type Data management project
Add your entities that you want to export.I will use the Re;eased product attachments entity for this.  Remember to check importable fields only at this stage. ( i will be using this template to import images later 

Hit export and download the package

Open the zipped file and and you will see 3 files and 1 folder
a. Manifest.xml
b. PackageHeader.xml
c. Release product document attachment.xlsx (This contains all the records with the file name in it.)
d. Resource folder ‚Äì this contains the files (inside the folder of the entity name) without a type. You will need to match the file name against the value in the excel file under the column ‚ÄúAttachmentFileName‚Äù. you will need to change the name of the file and type in order to open it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the fundamental challenges with artificial intelligence is that it 
has historically been out of reach for the many. With limited access to 
highly sought after resources, drawn out development times, compounded with 
the added complexity of needing special purpose infrastructure to 
facilitate the AI development process, there has understandably been 
various barriers of entry for the broader user base to harness the types of 
capabilities that fall under the AI domain.

AI Builder is part of Microsoft‚Äôs ongoing efforts to democratize AI, 
empowering users of all skill levels to build, train, and publish AI models 
in a no-code, guided, point and click environment. It‚Äôs now in Global 
availability state, anyone can infuse AI within their business applications 
with PowerApps, or add intelligence to automated work processes with 
PowerAutomate, especially like in Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations use 
cases !

For example, do you have the idea of an employee being able to just quickly 
take a picture of his expense report without having to recreate all the 
elements in your ERP? AI Builder scans the expense report, with approval to 
his/her manager and all this generates the elements automatically in 
Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations, magic isn't it? Let‚Äôs have a look !]]></summary>

provides a tightly coupled near-real time and bi-directional integration

entity is enabled for Dual Write, any create, update change in Dynamics 365 
Finance and Operations results in writes, in near-real time, to the Common

For example, a change in the Customer entity in Dynamics 365 Finance and 
Operations is reflected in near-real time in the Account entity in the 
Dynamics 365 Sales and vice-versa. While all this happens with minimal 
setup, an advanced user interface is provided with drag and drop mapping

and dependent demand at any decoupling point for customer orders. The 
enhanced demand forecast reduction rules provide an ideal solution for mass

To generate the baseline forecast, a summary of historical transactions is 
passed to a Microsoft Azure Machine Learning service that is hosted on

customized to meet industry-specific requirements. You can use Supply Chain

A typical metadata file (edmx) retrieved from https://<d365url>/data/$metadata will return a file of almost 17MB. Turn that into a c# file using the T4 templates and the C# source file is almost 64MB.
After spending some time trying to reduce the EDMX file to only the entities I require (and a lot of nagging by my friend) I created a way to remove the excess entities from here. Result is a smaller EDMX file, and a more lightweight .Net application for you.

Last week, we did it all, but in LCS the KB number stood stuck on 167. I downloaded the KB again on my local VM, installed again, and there was no code change.¬† I verified my merge to the release branch and again, it was all fine.

As we inspect 6880717, we find that the file contains the changed source code and a Package Manifest xml file. This Package Manifest contains information about what is changed and the KB number.


¬† 
This information of the package manifest is also stored in VSTS in the AxUpdate map. The filename is in above case is 6880717.xml.¬† But there is no information about KB number in it.
Good to know:
How do you know if you have this problem? In LCS on every environment there is a link called detail information.

Good merged combinations are Binary updates and x++ updates, but your own code can also be combined with your customizations on your Retail (SDK) part.
Till now I was not able to merge ISV packages, so those must be deployed separately.¬† However, there is quick dirty trick for local VM.

You must download the ISV packages and extract them all into the same map. Don‚Äôt bother messages like this file is already there, just override it.
On the end your ISV extracted content will look like this.

Next open the DOS prompt (just press file button in the file explorer and select DOS, your also directly on the right spot. Finally run the next 3 commands.
AXUpdateInstaller.exe generate -runbookid=‚Äùrunbook‚Äù -topologyfile=‚ÄùDefaultTopologyData.xml‚Äù -servicemodelfile=‚ÄùDefaultServiceModelData.xml‚Äù -runbookfile=‚Äùrunbook.xml‚Äù
AXUpdateInstaller.exe import -runbookfile=‚Äùrunbook.xml‚Äù
AXUpdateInstaller.exe execute -runbookid=‚Äùrunbook‚Äù
Most of the time you get an error telling you the runbook is empty, that‚Äôs correct look at the file DefaultTopologyData.xml

You just must add the xml that is shown below

        <updated>2016-04-14T02:48:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i had created a UI for the license generator.
To create a license in 2012 this was the command:
axutil genlicense /file:c:\licenses\MyLicense.txt /certificatepath:c:\certificates\MyCertificate.pfx /licenseCode:MyModule /customer:MyCustomer /serialnumber:1231232123 /password:MySecretPassword123 /expirationdate:12/30/2018 /usercount:5

However, having the password and certificate path information available wasnt exactly a good idea at that time (and probably is still relevant. Why would you want to distribute those two together no?)
So came the the License generator, with the password hard coded and everything else seemingly invisible to¬†the person punching the licenses without having someone with knowledge of the axutil and more importantly
What is this black box ? and why cant I just click somewhere

Moving forward a few years later and opening up the code out, (yes the password has been taken out of the code). Its now stored as well, although not very secure, but enough to keep prying eyes out for a bit. (this means rooms for improvement)
The code is published at GitHub under AxLicenseGenerator¬†(See the readme in that link)
Or you can¬†Download Ax License Generator 1.1
There is lots more information there, or message me if you need more information.
Happy Licensing
License Generator v 1.1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of changes have taken place in the X++ language and to align it close to the C# model which is where we want to be. There is no longer any p-code compilation, everything is run from the CIL.
This my compilation of what has changed and some examples for them as well.
Editing Experience: Visual studio interface only. Finally a more structured way of viewing code.
Declare anywhere:¬† :star:
The var keyword:¬†:star:
&amp;amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;amp;gt;
&amp;amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;amp;gt;var counter = 0;
var custTable = salesTable.custTable();

Static constructor and fields: Static member variables Static constructors: TypeNew
Macros: As i suspected, try avoiding these guys. Will be deprecated in later releases (my view) const (constant) and readonly: 
Field Access: :star:
Field access was only protected in Ax (no questions asked, and nothing else you can do about it)
Now: if you havent specified the access they are still protected, but you can specify public, or private
Access variables by reference:¬† :star:
:)
        this.Name = "Hello World!";
    }
}
class Access
{
    public AccessVariables()
    {
        var myVars = new MyVariables();
        myVars.Name = "Hello New world!"; // Name is accessed via the class object,no more Parm methods required;
    }
}

try / catch / Finally:¬†:star:
using statement: :star:
Implement .Net Classes:
:) , so your X++ class can implement IDisposable
Extension Methods:
There are very similar to C# extensions, except the convention is to end the class with _Extension and not Extension
Declarative Eventing (Methods and objects):
Ax 2012 gave us the ability to add events to methods.¬†This is still the same, i.e. events still exist, exept they are called declaratively (i.e. in code and no clicks).
Although, the¬†way to access arguments is still not to my liking and even though it seperates code out a lot, any errors are at¬†runtime only, which can be very ‚Äúhard‚Äù to manage
Casting is standard¬†now:

¬†
Moving a project to a different model causes Ax to move all the objects inside it to that model as well.
You could instead create a new project in the Model you want it and then drag all the objects into that. You will lose all the metadata of the project including timestamps.
Another way is to move just the object related to the Project to the right model.
For that use the following steps

Copy the Name of the Project
Find the ModelId you want to move it into. You can use Get-AxModel command for this. (this should be within the same Layer)
Open SQL and find the Element handle of the Project. Use the following command to do that

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just to share a quick tip. If you need to know which SSRS reports in AX gather data from AX OLAP cubes, you can run the query below in SSMS against the report server database.

      
 SELECT a.Path, a.Name as FullName,
 SUBSTRING(a.Name, 1, CHARINDEX('.', a.Name)-1) as ReportName,
 SUBSTRING(a.Name, CHARINDEX('.', a.Name)+1, 1000) as DesignName,
 a.Parameter, b.Name, b.Extension
 FROM Catalog a
 JOIN DataSource b
 ON a.ItemID = b.ItemID
 WHERE b.Name = 'DynamicsAXOLAP' 
 Order by a.Name, b.Name, a.Path          

The result is like this:

There are report name, design name and an XML presentation of the Parameters. The ReportName column contains the name of the reports, which match the nodes under \SSRS Reports\Reports in AOT.
