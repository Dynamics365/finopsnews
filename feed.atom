However, sometimes previous design is stuck on the server, and you still see no changes deployed, nevertheless, you already restarted Reporting services. Fortunately, there is a direct way to delete such a stubborn report from the server.
Open Report Server configuration manager as administrator and apply Portal URL setting if it is not done yet.


Then go for your report and delete it.

Note: we can create a join expression if a required relation does not exist for a given table.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Usage
We can use pack-unpack methods in RunBaseBatch classes and all its descendants to save and/or store the state of an object, and then later re-instantiate the same object.
We need it, for example, to use the user's input for any batch job: some parameters can be used when a batch job is executed on the server. 
Documentation
Microsoft doc article is here.
Quote: "A reinstantiated object is not the same object as the one that was saved. It is just an object of the same class whose members contain the same information." 
You need to teleport your objects without a fly or other bugs.
Case examples
Basics
Basic example of such a class is Tutorial_RunbaseBatch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction  
Account structures in Dynamics 365 Finance use a main account and financial dimensions to create a set of rules that determine the order and allowed values when entering account numbers in transactions.

It was also difficult to view the activation progress or to view any errors with the new configuration. If an account structure configuration change caused an error, a user could not find the root error message on the account structure page, but rather needed to dig through batch job logs to find the error message to understand the problem with the new account structure configuration.

qbdsInventBatch.clearDynalinks();
qbdsInventBatch.addLink(fieldnum(InventDim, inventBatchId), fieldNum(InventBatch, inventBatchId));
qbdsInventBatch.addLink(fieldnum(InventSum, ItemId), fieldNum(InventBatch, ItemId));
Invalid Field/Related field combination":


There are a few tricks how this can be resolved:


1. Create a view from InventSum and InventDim and use it as a single data source and then join InventBatch to it.
2. Start query from Inventbatch data source and then join to it InventSum and InventDim. However, considering the example above in most cases it will not be logical. But it might work in your case.
3. Use extended ranges. The solution will have the following look:
QueryBuildRange qbrItemId = SysQuery::findOrCreateRange(qbdsInventBatch, fieldNum(InventBatch, ItemId));
str itemIdRange = strFmt('(%1.%2=%3.%4)', qbdsInventBatch.name(), fieldStr(InventBatch, ItemId), _inventSum_DS_Query.dataSourceName(formDataSourceStr(InventOnhandItem, InventSum)).name(), fieldStr(InventSum, ItemId));
qbrItemId.value(itemIdRange);

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Real-time analytics reports provide visibility into the overall support performance of an organization, so supervisors can monitor key operational metrics, make course corrections at the right time, and keep service levels high.
Starting Monday, May 1, 2023, we are deprecating Microsoft Dynamics 365 Intraday Insights for Omnichannel for Customer Service reports and encouraging customers to move to Real-Time Analytics reports. This change is intended to ensure that our customers use our latest and best capabilities when it comes to real-time reporting.
Key dates

Disclosure date: April 28, 2023
We sent communications to affected customers that we are planning to deprecate the Intraday Insights for Omnichannel for Customer Service.

Deprecation date: May 1, 2023
After this date, we are no longer going to invest in Intraday Insights for Omnichannel for Customer Service.

End of support: October 31, 2023
After this date, we are no longer going to support the Intraday Insights for Omnichannel for Customer Service.

End of life: April 30, 2024
After this date, Intraday Insights for Omnichannel for Customer Service will be taken out of service.

Next Steps
We strongly encourage you to move to Real-time analytics reports in Omnichannel for Customer Service. We will be focusing our future developments on them, and these reports are our recommended solution for all Dynamics 365 Customer Service real-time reporting needs.
Real-time analytics reports provide information about the health and key performance indicators (KPIs) for your organization. Supervisors can use real-time metrics and review work distribution to adjust agent allocation. They can also drill down into agents’ ongoing conversations, view the customer sentiment, and join the conversation if necessary. 
Please contact your Success Manager, FastTrack representative, or Microsoft Support if you have any additional questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Customer service agents in a digital contact center handle multiple customer queries simultaneously and work on several support requests in a day. Often, they might spend extra time creating support cases, catching up on past activities, or performing simple case management processes. This leaves them with less time to focus on customer queries, which affects customer satisfaction. Enhanced case forms in Dynamics 365 Customer Service provide a streamlined layout to help agents expedite the case creation process and find relevant information quickly.

Need to Export a database for safe keeping?
MSFT has had database movement APIs for some time but I haven't seen a lot of use of them. I thought I'd provide a simple Power Shell script to show what can be done. You can make this more user friendly or modern by putting it in Power Automate or using a Logic App. For reference, the API specs and available operations can be found at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/dat...
 
Request A Database Backup
You can request a database backup on an environment like so:
# Update these values for your situation
https://login.microsoftonline.com/{DOMAIN}/oauth2/v2.0/token"       
USER@DOMAIN.COM}'

It's required by almost all countries where VAT is used and was previously available only to our customers in Belgium, Italy, and Norway. We're excited to make it available everywhere our Business Central customers are.
VAT is a tax that businesses must pay when they buy things. They can usually recover the tax by buying goods and services relating to their business activities. However, there are some situations in which a business incurs VAT that can't be recovered and isn't deductible.
The expanded functionality covers the most common scenarios and can be easily extended if you need more features.…]]></summary>

Let's state the problem.


We have two tables:

- mgcWarrantsDetails (details), which may have 0..N records for certain records from ProjTable.


Examples of data in both may look like the following:




If we apply standard outer join, the output will be as follows



But we need to print all details records by 'hanging' them against the same projId, like this



So, no duplicates from both tables must be present in the merged table.


This is how you can achieve it.

A bundle master item will have component items.  When you add the master item to a sales order, when you confirm the order, the Bundle master item will automatically be exploded and add the bundle components to the sales order.
When you add a bundle master item to a Call Center Sales order, this item will not be exploded to the sales line.  With a Call Center Sales Order, there is the added step of Completing the order and capturing the payment and the Confirm Sales order is not done.
When adding a bundle item to a Call Center Sales order, you will receive the following error:
                “Enter a base sale price on at least one bundle component”
Per the Revenue Recognition documentation:
Revenue recognition, including bundle functionality, isn't supported for use in Commerce channels (e-commerce, POS, call center). Items configured with revenue recognition should not be added to orders or transactions created in Commerce channels.
Currently, this is a limitation in the architecture for Call Center.

First, it's about matching the right seller to take the deal forward.  As a business owner or sales manager, finding the best seller to work on the new lead can really make or break a customer relationship. We need to look carefully not just at the seller with the highest close rate, but also balance that with their availability and expertise to attend to the customer’s needs and requirements.  
Applying the right business tactic to close a deal at the right moment is the second key to success. We must recognize where the buyer is in their sales journey and employ the right action to engage. If we can use technology to help provide…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been using the custom help toolkits for Dynamics 365 finance and operations apps or Dynamics 365 Business Central, then change is coming your way. If you've never used either toolkit, you can stop reading now.
What's changing
The custom help toolkits started out as a way to connect your own help content to Dynamics 365 and to customize Microsoft's help content. But times change, technology changes with them, and we no longer recommend that you customize our content. Instead, we recommend that you create your own help content using any tools you prefer, and then let that override Microsoft's content.
After April 11, 2023, the toolkits will be archived.
We're also removing content from our contributor guides that encourages customizing our content. Everyone can still contribute to our documentation, but in English only.
Why are you making this change?
The custom help toolkits are being used less and less. We know custom solutions are still running on versions that are or soon will be unsupported. We expect those migration projects will be complex enough that existing custom help can't be easily reused.
If you find that you need one of the tools in the archived toolkits, you can download a release package and extract the one you need.
What about custom help?
If you develop a solution that's based on Dynamics 365, you should continue to deliver documentation for its users. Use any tools you prefer.
If your solution includes Dynamics 365 Finance, Supply Chain Management, or Commerce, and you need to connect your content to the in-product help pane, download the AzureSearchCustomHelp solution. Learn more at Connect a custom help website to the Help pane.

1. When you do a "Blind return". This means you 'Return product' in POS without any settlement to the original sales transaction. Then Cost price might be zero.
2. When sales and return transaction is in the same statement (even 'Return transaction' is used). Then Cost price might be zero. Using trickle feed feature, it should be only about 2% when the scenario of having the sales and return in the same statement can happen. (For this one we have a feature request # 15482192 to analyze and improve in future versions).
In both above options we cannot find the original cost price.
How to avoid zero cost price in Inventory transactions:
When creating new product – you need to enter Default Purchase Price.
If you do not do that in step 1, you can enable ‘Latest cost price’ on a Product:
 
When the parameter 'Latest cost price' is enabled, Cost price will be filled in with Latest cost price once Purchase Invoice is posted.
Then this cost price will be automatically filled in Sales order return line in field ‘Return cost price’ and Inventory return transaction will be filled in with Cost price.
 
If above options are not accepted for your business scenario – you would need to create a customization.]]></summary>

Customers and prospects are busy people who don't always have the time to join a booked meeting, take a call or even engage via e-mail. Yet when the need arises, we want them to be able to get in touch with ease. 
Now in Dynamics 365 Sales we have made connecting with customers even easier by adding an SMS channel communication for our users. This channel provides another option to the sellers 'kit bag' to aid connection. 
It's a convenient and non-intrusive option to send reminders, provide quick updates, or respond to customer queries.

Usually, the primary key field of one table appears as a foreign key field of the related table. The table with the primary key is called the parent table. The table with the foreign key is called the child table.
 A relation on a table can restrict the rows in the table or restrict the values that can be fields. A common use of relations is to associate rows in one table with corresponding rows in another table. Relations enable many forms to display data from multiple tables.
 Some relations restrict the rows in the table by testing the values in each row against constant values. Other relations restrict the rows by comparing values in each row to values in a row in another table.

Git is a more modern source control system that has a lot of interest from Finance and Operations technical resources. There are a lot of potential benefits to use Git rather than TFVC. However, one of the hurdles to larger adoption of Git from X++ Devs is how Git really likes you to make new repos from an empty folder.

So what can we do? Bodge something together. We can use Powershell to move the repo into a directory once we've synced to an alternative location f…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing I appreciate about subscriptions is the automatic renewal process. It's nice to sign up for a subscription and not have to worry about manually renewing every time the contract period is up. This brings in automatic revenue for the company and keeps the hassle of manually renewing out of everyone's hands. 
Fortunately, the process for setting up renewals in Subscription billing in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations is fairly simple to execute as well. Let's dive in! 


Renewing Subscriptions
The process to renew a subscription set up in D365FO Subscription billing is done on the Billing schedule itself. When setting up your customer's billing schedule, there is a button to Renew automatically on the Billing schedule header. If this subscription should be renewed automatically, select this toggle and specify how many lines to add per renewal. 


Set the toggle for Renew automatically and specify how many lines to add per renewal


In my example above, I have a short billing cycle set for one quarter. I set the toggle for Renew automatically to Yes and Lines to add per renewal to 1. 
Once I invoiced the period, a new renewal line gets added to the Renewal section in the Line details for the line being renewed. The line shows who renewed it, the date it was renewed, and that it is, in fact, a renewal. 


See the renewals in Line details


If I navigate to View billing detail on the line, there is now a new billing line to be invoiced. This is the first automatic renewal line! 


Billing details now show a new line to be invoiced


Automatic renewals allow users to set up a billing schedule and continually renew the subscription until the customer decides to terminate it.]]></summary>

Managing the pipeline is one of the core activities of any seller; it helps sellers to stay organized and focused on moving deals forward. A seller who can successfully master the sales pipeline is likely to drive more revenue. 
But mastering a sales pipeline is not easy, especially when sellers must balance multiple active deals, an array of contacts, and conversations across multiple channels, while trying to figure out when the next interaction will occur, what next steps are required, and which app or process will help accomplish the job.

        <updated>2023-02-14T19:33:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the previous article, I explained how to create table field groups in dynamics 365 FO. In this article I will explain, how to make a field mandatory in dynamics 365 without customization or without writing any x++ codes.



In previous versions of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations (D365F&O), making a field mandatory required a (small) customisation. With version 10.0.0.12 this is no longer the case. Now it is possible to make fields mandatory using personalisation.

 
By using personalization, you can make a field mandatory writing a single piece of  x++ code.
 How to do this…
 In the following example, I would like to show you how to make Search Name field of Vendor form mandatory.
 To do this, 
  1. Simply right-click on the Search Name field of Vendor form. 
  2. Select the personalization option from the menu as shown in the below screen shot.


  

 3. A black color popup menu will open, then tick the “Required” option from the menu.


 
 
  4. Then Click on the Close button in the following popup. 



Now Search Name field of Vendor form is mandatory, and you can see a red and marked with an asteriskswhen updating or saving the record without filling any value in the Search Name field.


In the above example, I think it is very clear the concept,  how to make a field mandatory in dynamics 365 without customization, if this article is useful for you, please try to share this article with your friends who are looking for a career in dynamics 365. So happy coding with d365snippets

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given the myriad capabilities from the technology innovations and market categories, and the fact that service organizations are across the spectrum, what service leaders need is a convenient way to map them to different service levels of sophistication. Essentially, a service maturity model that groups major capabilities and maps them to appropriate levels in the spectrum. This allows service leaders to visualize where they are relative to the market and determine at what level they'd like to be based on their business goals, investment, and timeline. In addition, they can decide practically and prioritize on the capabilities that matter to themacross voice and digital channels, self-service, agent productivity and service operations.

What are Field Groups?
Field groups are Objects which can exist on tables, maps, or views, and that can group fields logically together into a single Object. These field groups you can use to appear on the user interfaces like forms, reviews, reports, etc. You should define a field group when several fields participate in a single function or are related in some way and are shown together on forms and reports.
Example for Field Groups?
In D365 F&O, the Customer Table contains many fields and field groups, The Credit field group contains fields that relate to credit like MandatoryCreditLimit and CreditRating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From time to time, we have all ended a subscription service. It happens - maybe the service doesn't meet your needs anymore. Perhaps it has gotten too expensive. Regardless of the reason, it is a common occurrence and Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance's Subscription billing module has a solution for terminating subscriptions.
Now you are probably thinking, "Oh great, something complex to add to my never-ending duties..." 
Nope! Terminating a Billing schedule in the Subscription billing module is easy, and I am going to walk through it. 


"I'll be back... when I am ready to subscribe again"


Terminating the Billing Schedule


Within the Billing schedule, you may notice that there are options surrounding Terminations. When you initially set up the Billing schedule, a Termination type will default onto the Billing schedule header. This field can be modified.




The three options are:



Adjust schedule
Bill remaining
No adjustment



The defaulted Termination type comes from the Recurring contract billing parameters found at Subscription billing > Recurring contract billing > Setup > Recurring contract billing parameters. 




Recurring contract billing parameters



Terminating Recurring Billing


Once on the Billing schedule screen for your Customer, there is an option to Terminate in the Billing schedule tab on the ribbon.





Once the Terminate dropdown is selected, there are options to: 



Select a Termination date

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often hear/see the words deprecate and depreciate used interchangeably, both in reference to ERP features and functionality. There is a difference in the words, and it's not just the letter i! This is a tough one, because even when you search on the internet, you get mixed results between the two. Let's look at the differences. 


This letter is not the only difference between these words!



Deprecate - There are several meanings behind the word deprecate, but as it relates to ERP system features and functionality, it means that the use of features and functionality are actively being discouraged because they have been superseded, or replaced, with different functionality. It doesn't necessarily mean the functionality is going away, but it will no longer be supported, and users are often actively encouraged to stop using it. 
Here is a link to D365FO's "Removed or deprecated features home page" - Removed or deprecated features home page - Finance & Operations | Dynamics 365 | Microsoft Learn




Removed or deprecated features home page





Depreciate - This is a term used in finance, typically with fixed assets as it relates to D365FO, to show the diminishing value of the asset over a period of time.

Syntax:

<filter_i> is one of the acceptable filter names, and 
<filter_i_value> are comma separated (and possibly quoted) filtering values.



Filter names:
Name: Filter by element name. This is the default filter, meaning if you just type a filter value, it is assumed to be an element name. Each comma-separated value is an acceptable element name.



Type: Filter by element type. Each comma-separated value should be the name of an element or subelement type (root type or subtype) (that is, table, class, field). Logic of filtering is:
(roottype_1 OR roottype_2 OR … OR roottype_N) AND (subtype_1 OR subtype_2 OR … OR subtype_N)

As a result of the discussion with the business SME, it was discovered that Power Apps or Dynamics 365 CE require a few additional relationships between the data fields.
Lets deep dive and understand the steps

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metadata search in Visual Studio
This article describes how to use metadata search to search your code and metadata for arbitrary patterns and content.
Given the large volume of the code base and metadata, it is often necessary to find things in the code that meet a certain criteria. For example, you might not know the name of the metadata element that contains the pattern or meets the criteria. Metadata search is exposed in Visual Studio through two user interfaces: the Metadata Search tool window and the Navigate To window.
Metadata search tool window
You can access the Metadata search tool window from the Dynamics 365 > Metadata Search menu command. Enter your search query to start the search. Results will start populating in the window asynchronously as you type. You can double-click a…]]></summary>

1
2
3
4
5
6



InventorySiteOnHandEntity
InventorySiteOnHandV2Entity
InventWarehouseInventoryStatusOnHandEntity
InventWarehouseInventoryStatusOnHandV2Entity
InventWarehouseOnHandEntity
InventWarehouseOnHandV2Entity





You can extend the ententies by adding new fields to tables and entities.
After you add fields to tables that are used by the inventSiteOnHandView view, you must sync the engine so that the extensions are correctly recognized.
Extend the InventSiteOnHandView view by adding the extension field.
Extend the InventSiteOnHandAggregatedView view with the extension fields.
Extend the InventSiteOnHandAggregatedViewBuilder viewBuilder class by modifying the getExtensionFields() method. In this way, you map old view fields to new view fields when viewBuilder synchronization is run.
For example, you’ve added the following four fields to the InventTable table through extension:
• Custom field 1
• Custom field 2
• Custom field 3
• Custom field 4
In the case, you must modify the getExtensionFields() method in the following way.]]></summary>

In D365 FO development you can directly input the labels, titles, or captions of any user interface, But in Standard project development, we need labels for displaying captions or titles in our user interface. The best practical method to achieve this goal is to use a label file. This label file contains a list of label IDs and related labels which are to be displayed on the user interfaces. You can call the label IDs to the user interfaces where you want to display the label. So, after creating a label file you must need to input a Label ID, a Label that is to be displayed on the user interfaces.
In this article, I will show you how to create a label file and how to use the created label file to display texts or titles on the user interfaces.

Enabling Users after a database refresh is a pain. Let's automate that away.
Re-enabling users in UAT after a data refresh from PROD can be annoying, especially if  you have to be granted access to the environment administrator's account. Let's work through one way of creating a pipeline in Azure DevOps to re-enable a list of users using D365.FO Tools, PowerShell and a few OData tricks.
First, Create an App Registration
You can use this link for a walkthrough. We only need a client ID and a client secret. Nothing else needs to be configured in Azure. This should be created in the same tenant as the environment we want to connect to.

Purpose of code reviews


Internal quality:


Overall approach – does the code do the right thing by proper means? 
Maintainability/extensibility – are we able to easily extend the solution, fix bugs etc.? 
Testability – are we able to test the code?
Documentation – are we able to understand why the code was made and what it does?
Performance – is the design correct from performance perspective? 


Functional testing: Some bugs are much more visible when looking into code
Knowledge sharing: Discussions between the developer and the reviewer

Store files for Attachments
Data import and export jobs
When FinOps prints a report via Document Reporting Services, SSRS Reporting Services generates an EMF image for each page of the generated document. FinOps then temporarily saves the generated EMF files to Azure Blob storage.

And more!
If you are using tier 1 Cloud-Hosted environment, you can find the azure storage from the Azure resource group in Azure portal.
For tier 1, UAT tier 2, and PROD Tier 3, you can create a runnable class and execute to get the Azure storage connection string.

PowerShell in a pipeline to request a database backup.
PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to automate a wide variety of tasks, including interacting with Azure DevOps pipelines. One common use case for PowerShell in an Azure DevOps pipeline is to request a database backup. This can be accomplished by using the LCS REST API to trigger a backup of a specific database, and then using PowerShell to monitor the status of the backup. This approach allows for a high level of automation and flexibility, allowing developers to easily schedule and manage database backups as part of their overall development workflow.
The Rundown, Again
All of the prerequisites to use this are available in this article. Nothing has changed. We're just hitting a different endpoint. To use this script, you'll need the following:
A user without MFA enabled in the LCS project with LCS permissions to request a database backup
LCS Project ID
Knowledge of LCS instance environment is in
LCS Environment ID
Once you have all of that, you can use this script to create a pipeline to request a database backup on whatever schedule you'd like. The script will start a database backup operation, pause, then confirm the request was accepted.

This can cause accounting and cashflow issues if the money was immediately available as revenue all at once. Therefore, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance offers Revenue and expense deferrals as part of their new Subscription billing offerings. Revenue deferral allows the revenue to enter a deferred account and be recognized on a schedule to be defined by the accounting team. Let's discuss how to set this up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When setting up Subscription billing, there are two options for setting up the Recurring contract billing Invoice transaction type - Sales order or Free text invoice. 


Parameters
Within the Recurring contract billing parameters, you can specify which Invoice transaction type you'd like the Recurring contract billing to be. This will be the default whenever you create a new Recurring billing contract unless you modify it at the header level. 




Invoice transaction type setting in the Recurring contract billing parameters

So, what should you choose? 


Free text invoice
The benefits of using Free text invoice include:



No need for items, just type in the description
Can set the pricing to whatever you want (automatically defaults the line to Flat pricing method)
Specify Main account per line, or set up in Deferral defaults



The drawbacks of using Free text invoice include:



Cannot use trade agreements for pricing, as there are no items




Sales order
The benefits of using Sales order include:



Flexibility with pricing
Can use Tier and Flat tier pricing methods using trade agreements
Can automatically set deferrals on specific items and item groups that cannot be done at the Free text invoice level




The drawbacks of using Sales order include:



You have to set up items (some people find this tedious 😉)



Conclusion
If you have a simple, straightforward approach to billing subscriptions and don't mind a little bit of manual entry, then the Free text invoice is a clear winner. 


If you have complex pricing, prefer to use items, and want to set it and forget it, Sales order invoice is the clear winner for you!]]></summary>

The methodology behind a couple of these pricing methods can be a bit confusing, so I am here to help de-mystify them for you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When signing up for a subscription, there are often different methodologies of how to pay for that subscription. Similarly, companies require different methodologies for billing. For example, some companies bill for their services at a flat rate per period. Others may operate on a usage basis, such as $x.xx per hour used. Lastly, some billing occurs as a fixed amount that gets billed when the goods/services are fully consumed.

The Subscription billing module in Dynamics 365 for Finance offers the flexibility to bill using these different methodologies. There are different Item Types and Pricing methodologies that can be used, and I am going to start breaking them down in this blog post for you today! This blog post will cover the different Item types available, and I will break down the P…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Subscription billing is a new feature that was introduced in 10.0.25. As more and more companies go to a subscription-based billing model, this feature has proven to be extremely relevant and beneficial! 


This is the first in a series of blogs I will be writing about this new functionality and what you can do to enable, configure, and use Subscription billing in Dynamics 365 Finance. Also, if you are attending Dynamic Communities' North American Summit October 10th-13th, 2022, I will be presenting on this topic there as well. 


Feature Management


Similar to Credit management, this new feature can be enabled (for now*) within the Feature management workspace. There are four new features to enable AND you have to disable one other feature if it is currently enabled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations, the layer system is used to manage application components in a predefined order. USR layer is the highest layer and SYS is the lowest layer. The purpose of layers is to give developers the option to modify Microsoft's code but only in one of the layers that the developer has access to.



The following table shows all layers and associated usage:


USR - The user layer is for user modifications, such as reports. 
CUS - The customer layer is for modifications that are specific to a company. 
VAR - Value Added Resellers (VAR) can make modifications or new developments to the VAR layer as specified by the customers or as a strategy for creating an industry-specific solution. 
ISV - When an Independent Software Vendor (ISV) creates its own solution, its modifications are saved in the ISV layer. 
SLN - The solution layer is used by distributors to implement vertical partner solutions. 
FPK - The FPK layer is an application object patch layer reserved by Microsoft for future patching or other updates.
GLS - When the application is modified to match country or region-specific legal demands, these modifications are saved in the GLS layer.
SYS - The standard application is implemented at the lowest level, the SYS layer. The application objects in the standard application can never be deleted.
The bottom layer would be the SYS layer, which is where the standard application code resides and is accessible only to Microsoft. Other layers like ISV (Independent Software Vendor) and VAR (Value Added Reseller) can be accessed by providing keys provided by Microsoft for each layer except USR (User) which does not need a key.]]></summary>

Development environments can be hosted locally or on Microsoft Azure. The build process, X++ compilation, and generation of cross-reference information typically run satisfactorily on machines with 16 GB of memory and two CPU cores. The compiler uses available resources, so more RAM and more cores will speed up compilation, especially if there is contention for resources from other concurrent processes. If you run concurrent processes, we recommend 24 GB of memory with four cores.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have ever imported data using Data management in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations and received an error before any records even went in, I am sure you were frustrated. 
Here are a few tips and tricks to consider before ever importing your data:


Ensure the data formatting in Excel is consistent
Custom or Special data formats in Excel will not import properly, use standard formatting always
Data that was derived from formulas will likely generate an error message. Copy that data and paste it back in as values instead of a formula. 
Check spellings - especially on data that is validated by the system (Address/city names, Dropdown values, etc)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Engineering and construction projects are mostly offered at a fixed price and almost every time require a down payment from the client. In Dynamics 365 for Finance, this is reflected by a Fixed-price project. Our accountants wish to book the advance payment invoice in the Balance sheet (Liability) and the partial or final invoice in the Profit & Loss section (Turnover).

We suggest creating a special VAT group to control the Advance payment milestone ledger integration.

restore ? From many years now on, I was (as partner) trying to do it the 
more automatically I can for customers - and even me in fact... But as of 
today, and as a gift for the community, I release a brand new solution to 
install it and manage that without any MANUAL actions for all steps 
required for data movement ! I hope that it will help you a lot - like it 
will help me a lot for me, believe me - tons of hours saved. Let’s jump in

2. Is this feature available for retail cash and carry, sales order/ customer orders and back-office sales order invoices?
Some details about the feature: 
Electronic Invoicing service – Saudi Arabia e-invoice integration - Dynamics 365 Release Plan | Microsoft Doc

E-invoicing integration for Retail for Saudi Arabia is not yet available. See the following release plan for more details:
Integrate e-invoices in retail stores in Saudi Arabia | Microsoft Docs

Regarding enabling this feature in on-prem deployments: the submission of simplified e-invoices will be done from Commerce HQ via the Electronic invoicing service.
The service is not available in on-prem deployments. None of microservices including Electronic Invoicing is available on-prem.

Customers using this deployment should consider moving to the cloud, using 3rd party solution provider or building integration with ZATCA using SDK themselves in ERP directly.]]></summary>

What is OCR? 
Optical Character Recognition. This is used to process documentation such as receipts and invoices by using Azure Cognitive Services to "read" the documentation and import the data into the system, cutting down on manual system entry.


Lifecycle Services
There is a component of installation that needs to be installed in your environment through Lifecycle Services (LCS). 
First, set up the Power Platform Integration. Use the standard template unless you are actively planning to use Dual-Write.

Set up Payment method with the Operation name ‘Pay credit memo’ and associate appropriate Posting accounts in it
Retail and commerce/Channels/Retail stores/All retail stores/select the store HOUSTON/Tab Set up/Payment methods/in our case it is called Voucher: 
Issue Credit Memo
Go to MPOS/Show journal/select sale transaction/ Select Return transaction/Return/select Products/Return/select Reason for return/OK.
Go to Actions/Transaction options/Issue credit memo:
Credit memo will be issued and transaction will be posted.
Now we can check if credit memo has been issued
Retail and commerce/Channels/Retail stores/Credit memos:
Credit memo is issued with the number 1.
Apply Credit memo
Enter Sales Transaction in MPOS and then pay it using the Payment method ‘Voucher’ (which has an Operation name ‘Pay credit memo’):
Enter Credit memo number 1 (the number we see in step 3):
Click Check amount, we see Available amount:
Click the button on bottom ‘Tender Payment’:
Now we can check if Credit memo has been applied
Retail and commerce/Channels/Retail stores/Credit memos:
You will notice that Applied check box is now marked, Applied amount and Applied date are filled in.
 
NOTE:
If you have Partial payment scenario, e.g. 1 credit memo $100. Buy items worth $40, how to use the balance amount $60?
 The system issues a new credit memo for the remaining balance automatically. 
If credit memos are only partially redeemed, the system issues a new credit memo for the new balance. The new credit memo has a new number. A credit memo can be used only one time, and the system keeps a record of all the numbers that are used. The record can be viewed on the Credit memo table page. A customer can't redeem more than the value of the credit memo.]]></summary>

She was using this feature often and everything was working. But now when she clicks "Sign in", it seems to runs for a little bit and then back to the below screen with the message "Not authenticated" at the bottom.



We tried different ways to tackle this issue but below is what eventually worked.

In the Excel add-in, click the gear button


Change the server URL to connect to another environment (e.g. a Tier 2 UAT environment)


Repeat #2 but change the server URL back to the Production environment
Just like magic, now the add-in connects without a hitch

Technology is just wonderful, isn't it?

EXEC sp_addrolemember ‘db_owner’, ‘devtempuser’


Whitelist your IP address
Select new query against Master DB
exec sp_set_firewall_rule N’DEVNAME’, ‘IP’, ‘IP’ 

Stop IIS, WWW service and Batch Service
Open IIS and stop the service. Open run and enter services.msc and stop WWW and Microsoft D365 batch service

Edit Web config
Go to C:\AosService\webroot\web.config and save the original file somewhere else as backup. Modify 4 Keys as per the below screenshot.
You can either comment original configuration or delete it and add new configuration of the sandbox environment

Start IIS and WWW services
Start IIS and WWW service stopped in step 5. Don’t start batch service.

Open the development environment AX URL
If you get 503 unavailable error, go to CMD(as admin) and type IISRESET

Debug
Now sandbox environment is connected to your development environment. You can simply open Visual studio to add breakpoints to X++ object and attach w3wp.exe service to debug.

Thanks Pawan Deep SinghI

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Union query may be a very efficient and useful option when you need to fetch similar data fields from different tables. A good example of this may be the case when you to gather information about project related transactions as they can be of different types, like, expenses, fees, items, etc. 
Say, we need to render some report collecting all these different types of transaction that can be posted against a given project and group them by a given financial dimension value in Project group. Let's see how Union query can help us.
In order to better understand the goal, you can take a look to the standard form ProjInvoiceJournal which perfectly explains how all these table relate to each other. 

Most of them contain the same set of fields, and we simply need to get some of them into one view to populate by the report data provider.
So, at the first step, let's create all necessary queries for the source Project transaction related tables. Pick up the first and create a simple query as depicted. 



Then create a view based on this query. 

Then pick up the next and do the same.


Complete these two steps for all necessary transaction types.
Now you can create a Union query and add all your views together as they have the same set of fields.


If you need to distinguish them later who is who, say, in computed column methods, you can use  unionAllBranchId field, but this is out of the current focus.

Finally you can elaborate it by adding a new view based on the latter with a simple SUM aggregation for Amount field.


Basically, you achieve your goal with no coding.
I am not going into details about the whole project, which you can get by this URL https://github.com/wojzeh/tmxProjectSalesPerSegment. Ping me, if you have any questions.

Then restart the VM by LCS or Azure portal, you will get the Dynamics back in the event viewer and able to start the trace normally.

Fourteen years ago Vania Kashperuk created a class which became classics: SysMultiTableLookup. It made possible to create lookups based on multiple tables. Some people are still looking for it in vain among the standard classes. So I decided to create a new version of it for D365FO.
It combines supporting for both lookup and lookupReference methods: performFormLookup and performFormReferenceLookup.
Vania added a tutorial form to his class, so did I. There is a form in the project, which shows how unbounded form controls can be looked up with fields and display methods from joined tables as well as the case with aggregation and a CustTable data source to demonstrate a lookup for a reference group.

What is a container in X++ ?
A container is a “composite data type”, which contains an ordered sequence of values (primitive dataTypes – int, str, real, date, boolean, enum etc.) or other containers or/and some composite data types.

One way to acknowledge the team's devotion is by implementing a reward and recognition scheme.
The project leadership team often lacks understanding and support for the individual team members, which can lead to problems like crises that may arise during a project.
One way to motivate a team member is to support and encourage them. Part of leadership is making sure that everyone knows that you're standing alongside them and will be by their side as the project progresses.

Many system integrators need to handle projects with skills that they don't have. It is inevitable that they will face this problem at some point.
Before deploying any resources into the project, organizations must invest in training and skills development.
A project without refactoring will quickly become inefficient and error-prone. As a result, your team's morale will be lower, design & build phase time will increase, and your implementation success rate will be slowed down.
Although the team had a longer learning curve than anticipated, they were able to get up to speed quickly. This is because there was no formal training and few resources with experience.

Dialogs are commonly used for small user tasks, such as filling the input values for generating a report, and presenting only the most important fields to the user when creating a new record etc. Since dialogues are used for small tasks, which is not commonly used for making complex forms, It also should not open a secondary window that requires user interaction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When importing Workers into Dynamics 365 Human Resources (now in D365FO), you populate the Worker data entity with as much information as possible. Then, start the import using Data management and after the import is complete, you check Human resources > Workers > Workers, and there are no records to be found. The import says it was successful, so where did the worker records go?
If you look around, you will find them in the Workers without employment filtered view (Human resources > Workers > Workers without employment.) 





Great, the records made it into the system, but I don't want to touch each record and add employment dates. How do we use the Data management functionality to add "employment" to these worker records?


Employment V2 Data Entity


A data entity called Employment V2 allows you to update the Workers' employment through Data management instead of old-fashioned manual entry. The mapping for the Employment V2 Data entity looks like this:




The fields within the mapping of the Employment V2 data entity include: 


CalendarID
DimensionDisplayValue
EmploymentEndDate
EmploymentStartDate
LegalEntityID
PersonnelNumber
RegulatoryEstablishmentID
WorkerType



Depending on your setup, the data within the Employment V2 data entity can be as simple as this screenshot. 



Once the Employment V2 data entity is imported, the Worker records will become active in the Human resources > Workers > Workers view in the Dynamics 365 Human Resources module.]]></summary>

When it comes to upgrading attachments from AX2012 to D365FO, only URLs, notes, and files saved in the former's database may be transferred to the Azure Blob Storage (on-cloud). 
Therefore, all files from attachments in AX2012 should be moved to the database first in order to be successfully migrated to D365FO.
What if there are millions of them? Technically speaking it might be a good option to save them on SharePoint (on-cloud); however, unfortunately, such attachments links will be deleted, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something happened while I wasn't looking and now we have a clearer sequencing of Credit management Blocking rules. This has been a much-needed change, and I am happy to report on it!
Sequencing of Blocking Rules


In the past, Blocking rules in Credit management have all run, regardless of what happened on another Blocking rule. 
This could cause frustration if a company wanted to stop processing once specific criteria had been met. 
As of version 10.0.21, you may have noticed some new options within the Blocking rules form. 
When setting up Blocking rules, there is a new column within all Blocking rules labeled "Release sales order." This can only be enabled on an Exclusion rule type.


What this "Release sales order" toggle does, is it allows for an Exclusion rule to bypass all other Blocking rules and process the Sales order if it meets the Exclusion criteria. 
Typically, Blocking rules get processed before Exclusion rules, and an Exclusion rule on the same level as the Blocking rule will not exclude that Blocking rule. This is the exception to that rule. 


New Sequence of Blocking Rules


Exclusion rule with Release Sales order checked
Blocking rules (Run in Table, Group, then All sequence)
Exclusion rules (Run in Table, Group, then All sequence)


Having rules in place surrounding how Blocking rules are run is a massive improvement. Here is the link to the documentation within Microsoft Docs: Credit holds for sales orders - Finance | Dynamics 365 | Microsoft Docs]]></summary>

GitHub is also an option you could pursue when moving to Git. GitHub has a lot of new features and offerings that Azure DevOps does not have.

Getting your pipelines fully converted to YAML will be the first step in making the transition to GitHub.

I use GitHub to host all of my community projects which is great for that. I can share the code and anyone can pick it up and use it as they see fit. Private repos are now also an option.

Developing in VS with Git is easy but I wanted to call out a few changes. First, you don't need to manually add items to your repo. Your repo will have a .gitingore file that says what can be committed - and what can't. If your .gitIgnore file doesn't specifically ignore it, it will automatically be added. Also, your project folder will need to be in the package directory more than likely (or somewhere under source control in the same repo as your code). If you're using the more than 1 package approach, it can be shared if you like. Additionally, there is no source control explorer. You can compare your changes against the branch you're in but that's it. However, you don't really need source control explorer as a developer. If you're coding, you can do …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you need not just to maintain lookup for a refence group but also to validate a manually input value, you need to implement resolveReference method for the field of the form data source. Say, we want to validate a custom financial dimension value.







You can check resolveReference* methods in EcoResCategory table as a good example.


The most interesting detail for me is the way how the related form control value is found inside of the given reference group.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's take a look at the lifecyle of a Git Branch.
Unlike TFVC, branches in Git are typically short lived when it comes to development. In TFVC you may have a branch for each developer or a branch for development in general, another for test then a release branch. In Git, we will be using branches differently. We'll get a change request as a work item in DevOps, review it, create a branch, assign to a developer to do the work plus commit it, optional build automation may occur, next a pull request, or PR, with a review and then the changes are accepted into the parent branch. We'll walk through this in specific details. In this example, we'll be using a bug but you can replace "bug" with "Feature", "Product Backlog Item", "Change Request", "Customization", "Enhancement", or any other word …]]></summary>

Basically, such parameters, like currency symbol etc, can be changed through System.Globalization.CultureInfo class created for the rendering culture. I did not find a way how to achieve it for a particular textbox in SSRS design. So, I formatted the amount directly in X++.

There are 2 options when looking at Git for managing your X++ code. The main driver for which option you select is if you will only ever have 1 package in your code base or more than 1. This include any ISVs or any other item that will have a code footprint anywhere in F&O. To learn more about packages, please see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/dev-tools/models. 
1 Package as a Branch
This option is the simplest. You would have 1 package as a branch. A good example of this is this GitHub project. It's a small package that add a features, it only depends on OOTB F&O packages and models and has no other dependencies not does anything else depend on it. It doesn't get any more simple than this. However, this may not work…]]></summary>

Using Git with 1 Package
When using Git for F&O, there are 2 basic flavors of using it; with 1 package or more than 1 package. This post will cover how to setup Git for use with 1 package.
To learn out to create a Git repo in Azure DevOps, please refer to MSFT documentation. To learn how to create a repo on Github, please refer to GitHub documentation.
Using Azure DevOps
In your dev VM, open Visual Studio then open Team Explorer. Click on Manage Connections then Connect to a project. 

Next, select your repo and place it in your PackagesLocalDirectory. K drive on cloud hosted machines and C on VHDs. 

Wait for it to clone and, that's it. Refresh your models like usual and you can develop against 1 package using Git in Azure DevOps. This is what the sync'd directory will look like. 

Using GitHub
In your dev VM, open Visual Studio then open Team Explorer. Click on Manage Connections then click Clone 

Log into GitHub then select your repo making sure to change the local path to include your PackagesLocalDirectory path.

Click clone and wait. That's it. Your repo folder will look like this:

Callout: If using VHD, drive will be the C drive rather than K drive.
Conclusion
Very straight forward process. However, when using this style of package manage, you will only ever be allowed 1 package. You can add as many models as you like but you'll only ever have 1 package. This includes ISV packages as well including binary or source packages. I recommend this style of management for personal projects or something you'll be sharing on GitHub. I wouldn't recommend this approach for use on an implementation project.

If you're reading this, I assume you're interested in getting away from TFVC for some reason, you're a technically focused individual, and you understand the differences between using Git and TFVC. 
Your Team
Your team should also be aware of what it takes to be successful in order to make a switch from TFVC to Git. They may need some additional training in order to get the the most out of Git. Developing and delivering with Git is a different exper…]]></summary>

The solution was built using Dataverse, Power Apps, Power Automate and Power BI. Over 100 Community Engagement Officers and Audiologists use it each month and it has become a single source of truth for program data. This has also helped secure continued funding from a government grant.]]></summary>

Source Control      

Want to use Git with more than 1 Package? Let's review.
The process to get Git working with F&O can be a little involved and it may not make sense the first time. The issue we're presented with is that Git assumes you are starting with nothing - a directory that doesn't exist. When you fetch source code - clone it - Git wants you to clone it into a directory that doesn't exist yet. Our PackagesLocalDirectory very much so already exists. So, we have to help Git by moving in pieces of the repo into the directory then get everything back in working order. There are a few different ways to do this: The Hard Way, the easier way, and the easiest way.
 
The Hard Way

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[what is a pull request? how do they work? what do they signify?
Create a Pull Request (PR)
The code is done but not the work. The developer still has to singal that his work is complete. We'll want to create a Pull Request or PR for short. There are 2 ways to do this. The first is in VS, which will just redirect you to Azure DevOps. The second is Azure DevOps. In VS, it can be found here:

In Azure DevOps, go to Repors, select your repo, select your branch then click "create a pull request".

Inside the PR, you can add some details for the PR. Additionally, reviewers and actions can be configured inside DevOps.

Notice you can select what you are creating a PR into. You can set a reviewer or additional reviewer if you'd like. Also notice that the PR is automagically associated with out bug work item. Let's create the PR.

As you can see, it merged successfully on its own and now we, or the approver, can approve and complete. Typically we wouldn't approve our own PRs. We'll see this when we complete.

We'll have an option for the merge type, if we want to use something different. Additionally, we have "complete associate work items after merging" checked as well as "delete bug200 after merging". This will resolve the bug setting it's status to done and deleting the branch we created for the work item called "bug200". Next, click "Complete merge". This is what the bug work item looks like after completing the PR:

The work item's status is "Done". Also note the links section. We can see that we had a commit and PR. However, the link to branch is now gone because the branch itself is gone.
Conclusion
Because Git Branches allow us to pull everything up, rather the push specific changesets like in TFVC, we can more easily keep track of what is where. As a for instance, until bug 200's work gets a completed PR, I know it's only in the branch for that work item.

I just want to re-iterate it and place here code snippets.



User can add new control using form personalization and this control won’t support overridden logic. It could be critical if you are restricting field lookup values or adding validations.
One form could have several controls that refers to one data source field so you have to duplicate your code.
Number of delegates are limited as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some big changes were made to Credit management in recent versions that need to be addressed. One of which is the following parameter: 
Bypass inventory reservations




A new parameter has appeared called Bypass inventory reservations, but what does it mean?




Release to Warehouse Credit Management Hold


There have been some observations made that when using the Release to warehouse Credit management checkpoint, the Sales order gets stuck in an infinite loop of going back on Credit hold after being released. This is occurring even if the order is Released to warehouse within the grace days defined. 





The Release to warehouse Credit management checkpoint in Credit and collections parameters



Microsoft has quietly released a fix for this in version 10.0.19 that is called Bypass inventory reservations. When this is enabled in the Credit and collections parameters, it will disregard inventory reservations when checking credit management blocking rules. Likewise, it will enable checkpoint grace periods regardless of inventory reservation quantity. 





Enable the Bypass inventory reservations parameter to avoid the Release to warehouse credit hold loop!





This has been a lifesaver for people who have found themselves stuck in an endless loop of Credit management holds when they try to release their Sales order from Credit hold then try to Release to warehouse!]]></summary>

Ik heb al heel wat datamigraties gedaan, maar om eerlijk te zijn houd ik niet van de volledige data- en codemigratie.
Dus ja, ik doe de codemigratie, maar de gemigreerde code is vanuit mijn oogpunt slechts een library met mogelijke herbruikbare oplossingen. We refactoreren deze code altijd, maar dat zal een impact hebben op de datamigratie. Dus, hoe kunnen we het op de juiste manier doen? We maken de nieuwe masterdata, en als deze taak is voltooid, moet je migreren naar de volgende topics. De truc is dat je ook de customizations van bovenstaande topics moet toevoegen op de data-entiteiten. Deze truc werkt zelfs voor AX 2009. Dus, hier is een overzicht van alles wat geëxporteerd moet worden.
Wat moet je exporteren?

We can use regular expressions to check if a given file name is valid.



    /// <summary>
    /// Validates a filename for incorrect characters
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name = "_fileName"></param>
    /// <returns></returns>
    public boolean checkFileName(Filename _fileName)
    {
        var bad = System.IO.Path::GetInvalidFileNameChars();
        var esc = System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex::Escape(new System.String(bad));
        var exp = new System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex("[" + esc + "]");
        
        if (exp.IsMatch(_fileName))
        {
            return checkFailed(strFmt("@SYS339524")); // The specified filename is invalid.
        }
        return true;
    }]]></summary>

This functionality allows for warehouse managers to plan the picking locations in the warehouse intelligently prior to releasing order to the warehouse and creating picking work. Slotting allows users to gather consolidate demand by item and unit of measure from orders, in status either ordered, reserved, or release. Once demand has been generated, it can be located to locations that will be used for picking based on quantity, unit, physical dimensions, fixed locations, etc. Once the slot plan has been established, replenishment work can be created to bring the appropriate amount of inventory to each location.]]></summary>

Zone based replenishment is a feature which utilizes min/max replenishment strategy but evaluates entire warehouse zones, if set, instead of just individual locations. This gives companies the ability to better and faster determine whether additional inventory is needed within a picking zone. The setup for the new feature is very similar to location-based replenishment. As new replenishment template is created for min/max replenishment, the user can simply specify whether the threshold should be evaluated per Location or per Zone. In case of zones, specific zones are then added to the Zone selection query and those will be evaluated by the newly created replenishment template when processed. Just like location-based min/max replenishment, the zone-based min/max replenishment is based on setting up a minimum threshold of inventory that triggers the creation of replenishment work order for selected items and item variants. In return, replenishment will be created for quantity that increases inventory up to the desired zone maximum threshold.]]></summary>

This features gives you the option of running the allocateWave method for wave templates in parallel to improve wave processing performance. On enabling this feature, this parallel processing will be activated and task configurations will be created for all warehouses from all legal entities that have "Use warehouse management processes" enabled. Each task configuration includes a setting that lets you define the number of tasks that will run simultaneously (which is equivalent to the number of parallel processes). Roughly, the time used on the allocate-wave step (which is typically 30% to 60% of the total processing time) is reduced by a factor equivalent to the number of tasks. It’s also possible to define the batch group that will be assigned to process these tasks. When this feature is enabled, all legal entities will process waves in batches and "Wait for lock" will be set to a default value of 60,000 ms if it was previously set to 0 ms. Other than this, the existing task and wave processing configurations will be kept for all warehouses that are already configured to process waves in batches, and for all warehouses that are already configured to use the allocateWave method in parallel. After enabling this feature, all new legal entities will be configured by default to process waves in batches, "Wait for lock" will be set to a default value of 60,000 ms, and all new warehouses with "Use warehouse management processes" enabled will have the allocateWave method configured to run in parallel by default. Existing warehouses for which you change "Use warehouse management processes" from "no" to "yes" will also run this method in parallel by default.]]></summary>

I have used this process to update invalid Customer accounts and to Void transactions.

First Calculate Transactional statement for a period that is closed.
When in the Statement form, Select Office icon in the upper right corner


Select Edit cash and carry transactions

Click Download


Save the file and open
Click Enable editing

You may get a message to “Trust this add-in”
Sign in
Data will refresh
Transaction tab
Validation Status = None
**Note:  Before you can edit a transaction, the Validation Status must be set to none and published
On the Excel file you can select all and fill down.
Publish

You can then edit the field you want to change
In this case I am changing the Business date to a date within the current period
 
Update the first transaction, then select all lines and Fill Down

Select Sales transaction worksheet and update business date
Select Payment transactions worksheet and update business date
Select Aggregation worksheet and update business date.
**Note: All worksheets that have the business date available should be updated or you will continue to receive errors on a closed fiscal period or Inventory is closed.  Don't forget the Aggregation worksheet.
 
Click Publish


Go back into the Retail Statement, select Revalidate Transactions to set the Validation Status back to Validated.

Hugo uses Markdown for its simple content format. However, there are a lot of things that Markdown doesn’t support well. You could use pure HTML to expand possibilities.
But this happens to be a bad idea. Everyone uses Markdown because it’s pure and simple to read even non-rendered. You should avoid HTML to keep it as simple as possible.
To avoid this limitations, Hugo created shortcodes.
A shortcode is a simple snippet that can generate reasonable HTML code and conforms to Markdown’s design philosophy.
Hugo ships with a set of predefined shortcodes that represent very common usage. These shortcodes are provided for author convenience and to keep your markdown content clean.

Note
        
Hugo extended version is necessary for style shortcode.
style is a shortcode to insert custom style in your post.
The style shortcode has two positional parameters.
The first one is the custom style content,
which supports nesting syntax in  SASS
and & referring to this parent HTML element.
And the second one is the tag name of the HTML element wrapping the content you want to change style, and whose default value is div.
Example style input:

{{< style "text-align:right; strong{color:#00b1ff;}" >}}
This is a **right-aligned** paragraph.

Environments on this version of Finance and Operations could encounter severe performance degradation or, in extreme cases, the service being inaccessible for a few minutes. The service will quickly recover but some unsaved work may be lost. 


To prevent further impact, we have disabled update 10.0.20 (platform versions 7.0.6060.45 through 7.0.6060.95) from being applied to environments at this time. Additionally, a fix for this issue has been released and is available in the latest Quality Update as KB# 4642180.
 
How does this affect me?
Our telemetry has identified that your environment is running a version of update 10.0.20 that does not include this fix. As a result, your environment is currently at risk of being affected by this reliability issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have identified a reliability issue within Finance and Operations update 10.0.20. Environments on this version of Finance and Operations could encounter severe performance degradation or, in extreme cases, the service being inaccessible for a few minutes. The service will quickly recover but some unsaved work may be lost. 


To prevent further impact, we have disabled update 10.0.20 (platform versions 7.0.6060.45 through 7.0.6060.95) from being applied to environments at this time. Additionally, a fix for this issue has been released and is available in the latest Quality Update as KB# 4642180.
 
How does this affect me?
Our telemetry has identified that your environment is running a version of update 10.0.20 that does not include this fix. As a result, your environment is currently at risk of being affected by this reliability issue.
 
What action do I need to take?
Please update your environment with the latest Quality Update as soon as possible to ensure the stability and health of your environment.
