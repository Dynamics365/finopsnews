However, sometimes previous design is stuck on the server, and you still see no changes deployed, nevertheless, you already restarted Reporting services. Fortunately, there is a direct way to delete such a stubborn report from the server.
Open Report Server configuration manager as administrator and apply Portal URL setting if it is not done yet.


Then go for your report and delete it.


Next deployment should be OK.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Extensible Data Security (XDS) policies allow restraint access to D365FO data in a very flexible way.
Business case: a user can see those purchase orders and their related confirmations only if he or she is Requester. The whole project can basically contain three objects: role, query, and policy.




After creating a specific security role, we need to create a query with HCMWorker table so that it is filtered for the current user.






All constrained tables should be added to the policy by referencing a particular relation (PurchTable, for example, has two relations with HCMWorker table; thus, we need to pick up the required one related to Requester field)








Note: we can create a join expression if a required relation does not exist for a given table.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Usage
We can use pack-unpack methods in RunBaseBatch classes and all its descendants to save and/or store the state of an object, and then later re-instantiate the same object.
We need it, for example, to use the user's input for any batch job: some parameters can be used when a batch job is executed on the server. 
Documentation
Microsoft doc article is here.
Quote: "A reinstantiated object is not the same object as the one that was saved. It is just an object of the same class whose members contain the same information." 
You need to teleport your objects without a fly or other bugs.
Case examples
Basics
Basic example of such a class is Tutorial_RunbaseBatch.

So you want to get into integration between Dynamics 365 CE or Custom Power Apps and Dynamics 365 FO. The question is, which type of Public Data entities are to be used from Dynamics365 FO?
As someone who's working on a list of integration approaches such as
1. Dual-write
2. Data integrator
3. Connector
4. API
Should I use Customers V2, Customers V3, or Sales Quotation Header CDS entity? What is the difference between these entities and tables?
It is always tricky to make decisions about which data entity to be used for the above-mentioned integration approaches, read on and I'll give you my thoughts.
If you deep dive more into available Dynamics 365 FO Data entities whether named with CDS or not under the hood it is connected with business transactions or master …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For example we need to tie following datasources:
InventSum
    InventDim
        InventBatch


InventBatch unique key index consists of ItemId and InventbatchId, therefore we need to link Invnetbatch with both InventDim and InventSum. However, if you try to do it using addLink method:
qbdsInventBatch.clearDynalinks();
qbdsInventBatch.addLink(fieldnum(InventDim, inventBatchId), fieldNum(InventBatch, inventBatchId));
qbdsInventBatch.addLink(fieldnum(InventSum, ItemId), fieldNum(InventBatch, ItemId));
Invalid Field/Related field combination":


There are a few tricks how this can be resolved:


1. Create a view from InventSum and InventDim and use it as a single data source and then join InventBatch to it.
2. Start query from Inventbatch data source and then join to it InventSum and InventDim. However, considering the example above in most cases it will not be logical. But it might work in your case.
3. Use extended ranges. The solution will have the following look:
QueryBuildRange qbrItemId = SysQuery::findOrCreateRange(qbdsInventBatch, fieldNum(InventBatch, ItemId));
str itemIdRange = strFmt('(%1.%2=%3.%4)', qbdsInventBatch.name(), fieldStr(InventBatch, ItemId), _inventSum_DS_Query.dataSourceName(formDataSourceStr(InventOnhandItem, InventSum)).name(), fieldStr(InventSum, ItemId));
qbrItemId.value(itemIdRange);

Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations (D365 F&O) is the cloud evolution of Dynamics AX, and how you access and report data from on-premise, versus accessing data from the cloud, has changed. The SQL database used to be on a server where the administrator could directly access the data to build a report. In a cloud-hosted...

Need to Export a database for safe keeping?
MSFT has had database movement APIs for some time but I haven't seen a lot of use of them. I thought I'd provide a simple Power Shell script to show what can be done. You can make this more user friendly or modern by putting it in Power Automate or using a Logic App. For reference, the API specs and available operations can be found at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/dat...
 
Request A Database Backup
You can request a database backup on an environment like so:
# Update these values for your situation
https://login.microsoftonline.com/{DOMAIN}/oauth2/v2.0/token"       
USER@DOMAIN.COM}'
https://lcsapi.lcs.dynamics.com"
# Install Azure PowerShell
# Install D365FO.Tools
# Install D365FO.Integrations
Get-D365LcsApiToken -ClientId $ClientId -Username $Username -Password $Password -LcsApiUri $LcsApiUri -Verbose | Set-D365LcsApiConfig
Invoke-D365LcsDatabaseExport -ProjectId $ProjectId -SourceEnvironmentId $SourceEnvironmentId -BackupName $BackupName -LcsApiUri $LcsApiUri -Verbose
 
Using that as a starting point, you can use this script to create a pipeline. All variables at the top of the script should be changed for your specific scenario. In a pipeline, they can be added as pipeline variables and secured within the pipeline.

Roughly a year ago I had to create a complex Dual-write table map and I couldn't decide the approach to start with Dataverse first or Dynamics 365 FO. However, I knew I wanted to use a custom data entity with a custom table of Dataverse to complete the data mapping. So I began a process of table mapping using Dual-write. I could able to complete the data fields mapping process and try to start the map to initiate the data sync. However, it failed in testing due to some missing fields or columns.
I had almost no experience with Dual-write troubleshooting to resolve the issue. The only option left with me was to step-by-step approach right from Dynamics 365 FO Data entity to Dataverse table fields.

Let's state the problem.


We have two tables:

Examples of data in both may look like the following:




If we apply standard outer join, the output will be as follows



But we need to print all details records by 'hanging' them against the same projId, like this



So, no duplicates from both tables must be present in the merged table.


This is how you can achieve it.

Usually, the primary key field of one table appears as a foreign key field of the related table. The table with the primary key is called the parent table. The table with the foreign key is called the child table.
 A relation on a table can restrict the rows in the table or restrict the values that can be fields. A common use of relations is to associate rows in one table with corresponding rows in another table. Relations enable many forms to display data from multiple tables.

How to use Git with PackagesLocalDirectory
Git is a more modern source control system that has a lot of interest from Finance and Operations technical resources. There are a lot of potential benefits to use Git rather than TFVC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing I appreciate about subscriptions is the automatic renewal process. It's nice to sign up for a subscription and not have to worry about manually renewing every time the contract period is up. This brings in automatic revenue for the company and keeps the hassle of manually renewing out of everyone's hands. 
Fortunately, the process for setting up renewals in Subscription billing in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations is fairly simple to execute as well. Let's dive in! 


Renewing Subscriptions
The process to renew a subscription set up in D365FO Subscription billing is done on the Billing schedule itself. When setting up your customer's billing schedule, there is a button to Renew automatically on the Billing schedule header. If this subscription should be renewed automatically, select this toggle and specify how many lines to add per renewal. 


Set the toggle for Renew automatically and specify how many lines to add per renewal


In my example above, I have a short billing cycle set for one quarter. I set the toggle for Renew automatically to Yes and Lines to add per renewal to 1. 
Once I invoiced the period, a new renewal line gets added to the Renewal section in the Line details for the line being renewed. The line shows who renewed it, the date it was renewed, and that it is, in fact, a renewal. 


See the renewals in Line details


If I navigate to View billing detail on the line, there is now a new billing line to be invoiced. This is the first automatic renewal line! 


Billing details now show a new line to be invoiced


Automatic renewals allow users to set up a billing schedule and continually renew the subscription until the customer decides to terminate it.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-02-14T19:33:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the previous article, I explained how to create table field groups in dynamics 365 FO. In this article I will explain, how to make a field mandatory in dynamics 365 without customization or without writing any x++ codes.



In previous versions of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations (D365F&O), making a field mandatory required a (small) customisation. With version 10.0.0.12 this is no longer the case. Now it is possible to make fields mandatory using personalisation.

 
By using personalization, you can make a field mandatory writing a single piece of  x++ code.
 How to do this…
 In the following example, I would like to show you how to make Search Name field of Vendor form mandatory.
 To do this, 
  1. Simply right-click on the Search Name field of Vendor form. 
  2. Select the personalization option from the menu as shown in the below screen shot.


  

 3. A black color popup menu will open, then tick the “Required” option from the menu.


 
 
  4. Then Click on the Close button in the following popup. 



Now Search Name field of Vendor form is mandatory, and you can see a red and marked with an asteriskswhen updating or saving the record without filling any value in the Search Name field.


In the above example, I think it is very clear the concept,  how to make a field mandatory in dynamics 365 without customization, if this article is useful for you, please try to share this article with your friends who are looking for a career in dynamics 365. So happy coding with d365snippets

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From time to time, we have all ended a subscription service. It happens - maybe the service doesn't meet your needs anymore. Perhaps it has gotten too expensive. Regardless of the reason, it is a common occurrence and Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance's Subscription billing module has a solution for terminating subscriptions.
Now you are probably thinking, "Oh great, something complex to add to my never-ending duties..." 
Nope! Terminating a Billing schedule in the Subscription billing module is easy, and I am going to walk through it. 


"I'll be back... when I am ready to subscribe again"


Terminating the Billing Schedule


Within the Billing schedule, you may notice that there are options surrounding Terminations. When you initially set up the Billing schedule, a Termination type will default onto the Billing schedule header. This field can be modified.




The three options are:



Adjust schedule
Bill remaining
No adjustment



The defaulted Termination type comes from the Recurring contract billing parameters found at Subscription billing > Recurring contract billing > Setup > Recurring contract billing parameters. 




Recurring contract billing parameters



Terminating Recurring Billing


Once on the Billing schedule screen for your Customer, there is an option to Terminate in the Billing schedule tab on the ribbon.





Once the Terminate dropdown is selected, there are options to: 



Select a Termination date
Select the Termination type
Select the Credit option
Choose to Prorate daily (or not)
Select a Reason code
Provide Termination notes






Once the fields are populated, select to Terminate or Terminate with refund. All billing schedule lines will be terminated based on the date selected. 




Once the Termination is complete, a notification will alert you to how many lines were terminated, and Termination can be removed from the account by selecting Remove termination in the ribbon.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often hear/see the words deprecate and depreciate used interchangeably, both in reference to ERP features and functionality. There is a difference in the words, and it's not just the letter i! This is a tough one, because even when you search on the internet, you get mixed results between the two. Let's look at the differences. 


This letter is not the only difference between these words!



Deprecate - There are several meanings behind the word deprecate, but as it relates to ERP system features and functionality, it means that the use of features and functionality are actively being discouraged because they have been superseded, or replaced, with different functionality. It doesn't necessarily mean the functionality is going away, but it will no longer be supported, and users are often actively encouraged to stop using it. 
Here is a link to D365FO's "Removed or deprecated features home page" - Removed or deprecated features home page - Finance & Operations | Dynamics 365 | Microsoft Learn




Removed or deprecated features home page





Depreciate - This is a term used in finance, typically with fixed assets as it relates to D365FO, to show the diminishing value of the asset over a period of time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metadata search in Visual Studio
This article describes how to use metadata search to search your code and metadata for arbitrary patterns and content.
Given the large volume of the code base and metadata, it is often necessary to find things in the code that meet a certain criteria. For example, you might not know the name of the metadata element that contains the pattern or meets the criteria. Metadata search is exposed in Visual Studio through two user interfaces: the Metadata Search tool window and the Navigate To window.
Metadata search tool window
You can access the Metadata search tool window from the Dynamics 365 > Metadata Search menu command. Enter your search query to start the search. Results will start populating in the window asynchronously as you type. You can double-click a…]]></summary>

Syntax:

<filter_i> is one of the acceptable filter names, and 
<filter_i_value> are comma separated (and possibly quoted) filtering values.



Filter names:
Name: Filter by element name. This is the default filter, meaning if you just type a filter value, it is assumed to be an element name. Each comma-separated value is an acceptable element name.



Type: Filter by element type. Each comma-separated value should be the name of an element or subelement type (root type or subtype) (that is, table, class, field). Logic of filtering is:
(roottype_1 OR roottype_2 OR … OR roottype_N) AND (subtype_1 OR subtype_2 OR … OR subtype_N)

In this article, I will explain how to create a table in Dynamics 365 FO. As we know tables are the core objects used to store data in Microsoft Dynamics 365. In Dynamics 365 FO before creating a form we need to create the tables first. By using visual studio, it is very easy to create a table.
In Dynamics 365 FO, you can use primitive data types or Extended data types for adding fields to the table. Before creating a new Extended data type (EDTs), you should check whether the EDT is already existing in the system, if already exists in the system, you can re-use it.

I'll also be likening each part of the article to a map from classic DOOM (1993). For those of you DOOM fans out there, this should be fun. For …]]></summary>

Metadata search is exposed in Visual Studio through two user interfaces: the Metadata Search tool window and the Navigate To window.

Purpose of code reviews


Internal quality:


Overall approach – does the code do the right thing by proper means? 
Maintainability/extensibility – are we able to easily extend the solution, fix bugs etc.? 
Testability – are we able to test the code?
Documentation – are we able to understand why the code was made and what it does?
Performance – is the design correct from performance perspective? 


Functional testing: Some bugs are much more visible when looking into code
Knowledge sharing: Discussions between the developer and the reviewer

PowerShell in a pipeline to request a database backup.
PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to automate a wide variety of tasks, including interacting with Azure DevOps pipelines. One common use case for PowerShell in an Azure DevOps pipeline is to request a database backup. This can be accomplished by using the LCS REST API to trigger a backup of a specific database, and then using PowerShell to monitor the status of the backup. This approach allows for a high level of automation and flexibility, allowing developers to easily schedule and manage database backups as part of their overall development workflow.
The Rundown, Again
All of the prerequisites to use this are available in this article. Nothing has changed. We're just hitting a different endpoint. To use this script, you'll need the following:
A user without MFA enabled in the LCS project with LCS permissions to request a database backup
LCS Project ID
Knowledge of LCS instance environment is in
LCS Environment ID
Once you have all of that, you can use this script to create a pipeline to request a database backup on whatever schedule you'd like. The script will start a database backup operation, pause, then confirm the request was accepted.

Lookups are the standard way to display a list of possible selection values to the user. For a user, while editing or creating database records, a lookup makes the data entry easy and errorless. In Microsoft dynamics 365 finance and operations, there are many ways of creating lookups.
EDT and Table Relation Type lookups are the simplest forms of lookups in Microsoft dynamics 365 finance and operations.
In this article, I will describe the very simplest type of lookup, which is EDT lookup, for making an EDT type lookup, a developer does not need to worry more about writing x++ coding,

This can cause accounting and cashflow issues if the money was immediately available as revenue all at once. Therefore, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance offers Revenue and expense deferrals as part of their new Subscription billing offerings. Revenue deferral allows the revenue to enter a deferred account and be recognized on a schedule to be defined by the accounting team. Let's discuss how to set this up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When setting up Subscription billing, there are two options for setting up the Recurring contract billing Invoice transaction type - Sales order or Free text invoice. 


Parameters
Within the Recurring contract billing parameters, you can specify which Invoice transaction type you'd like the Recurring contract billing to be. This will be the default whenever you create a new Recurring billing contract unless you modify it at the header level. 




Invoice transaction type setting in the Recurring contract billing parameters

So, what should you choose? 


Free text invoice
The benefits of using Free text invoice include:



No need for items, just type in the description
Can set the pricing to whatever you want (automatically defaults the line to Flat pricing method)
Specify Main account per line, or set up in Deferral defaults



The drawbacks of using Free text invoice include:



Cannot use trade agreements for pricing, as there are no items




Sales order
The benefits of using Sales order include:



Flexibility with pricing
Can use Tier and Flat tier pricing methods using trade agreements
Can automatically set deferrals on specific items and item groups that cannot be done at the Free text invoice level




The drawbacks of using Sales order include:



You have to set up items (some people find this tedious 😉)



Conclusion
If you have a simple, straightforward approach to billing subscriptions and don't mind a little bit of manual entry, then the Free text invoice is a clear winner. 


If you have complex pricing, prefer to use items, and want to set it and forget it, Sales order invoice is the clear winner for you!]]></summary>

Similarly, companies require different methodologies for billing. For example, some companies bill for their services at a flat rate per period. Others may operate on a usage basis, such as $x.xx per hour used. Lastly, some billing occurs as a fixed amount that gets billed when the goods/services are fully consumed.

This is the first in a series of blogs I will be writing about this new functionality and what you can do to enable, configure, and use Subscription billing in Dynamics 365 Finance. Also, if you are attending Dynamic Communities' North American Summit October 10th-13th, 2022, I will be presenting on this topic there as well.

Similar to Credit management, this new feature can be enabled (for now*) within the Feature management workspace. There are four new features to enable AND you have to disable one other feature if it is currently enabled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations, the layer system is used to manage application components in a predefined order. USR layer is the highest layer and SYS is the lowest layer. The purpose of layers is to give developers the option to modify Microsoft's code but only in one of the layers that the developer has access to.



The following table shows all layers and associated usage:


USR - The user layer is for user modifications, such as reports. 
CUS - The customer layer is for modifications that are specific to a company. 
VAR - Value Added Resellers (VAR) can make modifications or new developments to the VAR layer as specified by the customers or as a strategy for creating an industry-specific solution. 
ISV - When an Independent Software Vendor (ISV) creates its own solution, its modifications are saved in the ISV layer. 
SLN - The solution layer is used by distributors to implement vertical partner solutions. 
FPK - The FPK layer is an application object patch layer reserved by Microsoft for future patching or other updates.
GLS - When the application is modified to match country or region-specific legal demands, these modifications are saved in the GLS layer.
SYS - The standard application is implemented at the lowest level, the SYS layer. The application objects in the standard application can never be deleted.
The bottom layer would be the SYS layer, which is where the standard application code resides and is accessible only to Microsoft. Other layers like ISV (Independent Software Vendor) and VAR (Value Added Reseller) can be accessed by providing keys provided by Microsoft for each layer except USR (User) which does not need a key.]]></summary>

Development environments can be hosted locally or on Microsoft Azure. The build process, X++ compilation, and generation of cross-reference information typically run satisfactorily on machines with 16 GB of memory and two CPU cores. The compiler uses available resources, so more RAM and more cores will speed up compilation, especially if there is contention for resources from other concurrent processes. If you run concurrent processes, we recommend 24 GB of memory with four cores. A minimum of two CPU cores is recommended because the developer environment contains many components running simultaneously.

Long story short, there are two sets of Data entities in Dynamics 365 FO.
Standard data entities
Dual-write specific data entities (Postfix as CDSEntity)
The core purpose of having these categorizations is to manage, simplify & better control ALM, CE & ERP-related business scenarios, External party integration, or some processes that required some additional logic to be called to handshake with other downstream processes.

How Does It Work Under The Hood?
This is more about how data entities are designed in Dynamics 365 FO.
Dynamics 365 FO data entities are more complex since they encompass a wide range of data sources.

Here are a few tips and tricks to consider before ever importing your data:


Ensure the data formatting in Excel is consistent
Custom or Special data formats in Excel will not import properly, use standard formatting always
Data that was derived from formulas will likely generate an error message. Copy that data and paste it back in as values instead of a formula. 
Check spellings - especially on data that is validated by the system (Address/city names, Dropdown values, etc)


Once your data is clean, you can still get errors. Here are some common errors that you can run into before any records ever…]]></summary>

When considering the Dynamics 365 Cross-Apps solution design, it is imperative to understand the internal dynamics of each system. Each system has its own capabilities and limitations.
And when it comes to transaction commitment to the database, each system has its own transaction tracking mechanism. Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations and Dataverse are not exceptions to this rule.
Transaction tracking mechanisms exist to ensure data integrity. I'm sure you have used either application before.
With Dynamics 365 FO, every transaction is part of the transaction scope, and a single transaction scope can include multiple changes. Sometimes it will be a complex case based on your business scenario.

We suggest creating a special VAT group to control the Advance payment milestone ledger integration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New article here to explain a new solution I have made for Data ALM (and 
automation everywhere) in terms of data movement for Dynamics 365 Finance 
Operations. For the code ALM part, and even for RSAT, all the way it’s 
quite really easy to manage from development to release (especially thanks 
to Azure Dev Ops). But what about data / refresh / copy / backup and 
restore ? From many years now on, I was (as partner) trying to do it the 
more automatically I can for customers - and even me in fact... But as of 
today, and as a gift for the community, I release a brand new solution to 
install it and manage that without any MANUAL actions for all steps 
required for data movement ! I hope that it will help you a lot - like it 
will help me a lot for me, believe me - tons of hours saved. Let’s jump in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently got to implement OCR in Expense management in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. Turns out, there is a lot of interest in this topic, so I put together a little blog about it. 


What is OCR? 
Optical Character Recognition. This is used to process documentation such as receipts and invoices by using Azure Cognitive Services to "read" the documentation and import the data into the system, cutting down on manual system entry.


Lifecycle Services
There is a component of installation that needs to be installed in your environment through Lifecycle Services (LCS). 
First, set up the Power Platform Integration. Use the standard template unless you are actively planning to use Dual-Write. 


When connecting, this is the information you will see:

We need your feedback on this feature and you can start providing it today. This feature is designed to boost developer productivity by eliminating the overhead of using ILMerge to manually merge dependent assemblies. With dependent assemblies, rather than register an individual .NET assembly, you will upload a NuGet Package that contains your plug-in assembly AND any dependent assemblies. Unlike ILMerge, you can also include other file resources, such as JSON files containing localized strings.]]></summary>

How do achieve this task? is it possible to change the structure of existing base tables in dynamics 365? Yes,  In dynamics 365 this task is achieved by using the extension method.
An extension is a way to add functionality to an existing object in D365FO without modifying the base code of that object. Your extensions are compiled into their own DLLs, which are separate from the D365 base system libraries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Above mentioned steps can be reduced to only one step i.e refresh of production DB to sandbox via LCS and later we can connect to sandbox environment directly from the development environment for debugging using below guide

Time required 20 minutes.
Steps

Enable access for your IP address
Go to lcs ->sandbox environment page. To connect to test environment RDP, you need to create Whitelist rule for your IP address 

Connect RDP and open SSMS

Connect to SQL server using Server name from LCS and add the prefix to SQL server name – servername.database.windows.net

Create a new query to test DB
Below query will create a new user that will be used for debugging
CREATE USER devtempuser WITH PASSWORD = ‘pass@word1’
EXEC sp_addrolemember ‘db_owner’, ‘devtempuser’


Whitelist your IP address
Select new query against Master DB
exec sp_set_firewall_rule N’DEVNAME’, ‘IP’, ‘IP’ 

Stop IIS, WWW service and Batch Service
Open IIS and stop the service. Open run and enter services.msc and stop WWW and Microsoft D365 batch service

Edit Web config
Go to C:\AosService\webroot\web.config and save the original file somewhere else as backup. Modify 4 Keys as per the below screenshot.
You can either comment original configuration or delete it and add new configuration of the sandbox environment

Start IIS and WWW services
Start IIS and WWW service stopped in step 5. Don’t start batch service.

Open the development environment AX URL
If you get 503 unavailable error, go to CMD(as admin) and type IISRESET

Debug
Now sandbox environment is connected to your development environment. You can simply open Visual studio to add breakpoints to X++ object and attach w3wp.exe service to debug.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Union query may be a very efficient and useful option when you need to fetch similar data fields from different tables. A good example of this may be the case when you to gather information about project related transactions as they can be of different types, like, expenses, fees, items, etc. 
Say, we need to render some report collecting all these different types of transaction that can be posted against a given project and group them by a given financial dimension value in Project group. Let's see how Union query can help us.
In order to better understand the goal, you can take a look to the standard form ProjInvoiceJournal which perfectly explains how all these table relate to each other. 

Most of them contain the same set of fields, and we simply need to get some of them into one view to populate by the report data provider.
So, at the first step, let's create all necessary queries for the source Project transaction related tables. Pick up the first and create a simple query as depicted. 



Then create a view based on this query. 

Then pick up the next and do the same.


Complete these two steps for all necessary transaction types.
Now you can create a Union query and add all your views together as they have the same set of fields.


If you need to distinguish them later who is who, say, in computed column methods, you can use  unionAllBranchId field, but this is out of the current focus.

Finally you can elaborate it by adding a new view based on the latter with a simple SUM aggregation for Amount field.


Basically, you achieve your goal with no coding.
I am not going into details about the whole project, which you can get by this URL https://github.com/wojzeh/tmxProjectSalesPerSegment. Ping me, if you have any questions.

Fourteen years ago Vania Kashperuk created a class which became classics: SysMultiTableLookup. It made possible to create lookups based on multiple tables. Some people are still looking for it in vain among the standard classes. So I decided to create a new version of it for D365FO.
It combines supporting for both lookup and lookupReference methods: performFormLookup and performFormReferenceLookup.
Vania added a tutorial form to his class, so did I. There is a form in the project, which shows how unbounded form controls can be looked up with fields and display methods from joined tables as well as the case with aggregation and a CustTable data source to demonstrate a lookup for a reference group.

Examples for primitive data types are int, str, real …. etc and examples for composite data types Arrays, Containers, Collection Classes.
What is a container in X++ ?
A container is a “composite data type”, which contains an ordered sequence of values (primitive dataTypes – int, str, real, date, boolean, enum etc.) or other containers or/and some composite data types.

Before deploying any resources into the project, organizations must invest in training and skills development.
A project without refactoring will quickly become inefficient and error-prone. As a result, your team's morale will be lower, design & build phase time will increase, and your implementation success rate will be slowed down.
Although the team had a longer learning curve than anticipated, they were able to get up to speed quickly. This is because there was no formal training and few resources with experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NSF, or Non-sufficient funds, are payments that have been received that are rejected by the bank as the account tied to the payment does not have sufficient funds to be paid out. These are often referred to as "bounced checks." This blog will detail how to set up and utilize the NSF functionality in Dynamics 365 for Finance to reverse the payment and mark it as NSF.






Setup - Bank Account
There is some preliminary setup that needs to be done on the bank account for NSF functionality to work. Navigate to Cash and bank management > Bank accounts > Bank accounts. Open the Bank account where you receive customer payments.
There, in the Payment management FastTab, you can mark a specific charges group and the name of the payment journal type you want to use for NSF payment reversals.

Then, start the import using Data management and after the import is complete, you check Human resources > Workers > Workers, and there are no records to be found. The import says it was successful, so where did the worker records go?
If you look around, you will find them in the Workers without employment filtered view (Human resources > Workers > Workers without employment.) 





Great, the records made it into the system, but I don't want to touch each record and add employment dates. How do we use the Data management functionality to add "employment" to these worker records?


Employment V2 Data Entity


A data entity called Employment V2 allows you to update the Workers' employment through Data management instead of old-fashioned manual entry. The mapping for the Employment V2 Data entity looks like this:




The fields within the mapping of the Employment V2 data entity include: 


CalendarID
DimensionDisplayValue
EmploymentEndDate
EmploymentStartDate
LegalEntityID
PersonnelNumber
RegulatoryEstablishmentID
WorkerType



Depending on your setup, the data within the Employment V2 data entity can be as simple as this screenshot.

When it comes to upgrading attachments from AX2012 to D365FO, only URLs, notes, and files saved in the former's database may be transferred to the Azure Blob Storage (on-cloud). 
Therefore, all files from attachments in AX2012 should be moved to the database first in order to be successfully migrated to D365FO.
What if there are millions of them? Technically speaking it might be a good option to save them on SharePoint (on-cloud); however, unfortunately, such attachments links will be deleted, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something happened while I wasn't looking and now we have a clearer sequencing of Credit management Blocking rules. This has been a much-needed change, and I am happy to report on it!
Sequencing of Blocking Rules


In the past, Blocking rules in Credit management have all run, regardless of what happened on another Blocking rule. 
This could cause frustration if a company wanted to stop processing once specific criteria had been met. 
As of version 10.0.21, you may have noticed some new options within the Blocking rules form. 
When setting up Blocking rules, there is a new column within all Blocking rules labeled "Release sales order." This can only be enabled on an Exclusion rule type.


What this "Release sales order" toggle does, is it allows for an Exclusion rule to bypass all other Blocking rules and process the Sales order if it meets the Exclusion criteria. 
Typically, Blocking rules get processed before Exclusion rules, and an Exclusion rule on the same level as the Blocking rule will not exclude that Blocking rule. This is the exception to that rule. 


New Sequence of Blocking Rules


Exclusion rule with Release Sales order checked
Blocking rules (Run in Table, Group, then All sequence)
Exclusion rules (Run in Table, Group, then All sequence)


Having rules in place surrounding how Blocking rules are run is a massive improvement. Here is the link to the documentation within Microsoft Docs: Credit holds for sales orders - Finance | Dynamics 365 | Microsoft Docs]]></summary>

GitHub is also an option you could pursue when moving to Git. GitHub has a lot of new features and offerings that Azure DevOps does not have.

Getting your pipelines fully converted to YAML will be the first step in making the transition to GitHub.

I use GitHub to host all of my community projects which is great for that. I can share the code and anyone can pick it up and use it as they see fit. Private repos are now also an option.

Developing in VS with Git is easy but I wanted to call out a few changes. First, you don't need to manually add items to your repo. Your repo will have a .gitingore file that says what can be committed - and what can't. If your .gitIgnore file doesn't specifically ignore it, it will automatically be added. Also, your project folder will need to be in the package directory more than likely (or somewhere under source control in the same repo as your code). If you're using the more than 1 package approach, it can be shared if you like. Additionally, there is no source control explorer. You can compare your changes against the branch you're in but that's it. However, you don't really need source control explorer as a developer. If you're coding, you can do …]]></summary>

Unlike TFVC, branches in Git are typically short lived when it comes to development. In TFVC you may have a branch for each developer or a branch for development in general, another for test then a release branch. In Git, we will be using branches differently. We'll get a change request as a work item in DevOps, review it, create a branch, assign to a developer to do the work plus commit it, optional build automation may occur, next a pull request, or PR, with a review and then the changes are accepted into the parent branch. We'll walk through this in specific details. In this example, we'll be using a bug but you can replace "bug" with "Feature", "Product Backlog Item", "Change Request", "Customization", "Enhancement", or any other word …]]></summary>

There are 2 options when looking at Git for managing your X++ code. The main driver for which option you select is if you will only ever have 1 package in your code base or more than 1. This include any ISVs or any other item that will have a code footprint anywhere in F&O. To learn more about packages, please see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/dev-tools/models. 
1 Package as a Branch
This option is the simplest. You would have 1 package as a branch. A good example of this is this GitHub project. It's a small package that add a features, it only depends on OOTB F&O packages and models and has no other dependencies not does anything else depend on it. It doesn't get any more simple than this. However, this may not work…]]></summary>

Using Git with 1 Package
When using Git for F&O, there are 2 basic flavors of using it; with 1 package or more than 1 package. This post will cover how to setup Git for use with 1 package.
To learn out to create a Git repo in Azure DevOps, please refer to MSFT documentation. To learn how to create a repo on Github, please refer to GitHub documentation.
Using Azure DevOps
In your dev VM, open Visual Studio then open Team Explorer. Click on Manage Connections then Connect to a project. 

Next, select your repo and place it in your PackagesLocalDirectory. K drive on cloud hosted machines and C on VHDs. 

Wait for it to clone and, that's it. Refresh your models like usual and you can develop against 1 package using Git in Azure DevOps. This is what the sync'd directory will look like. 

Using GitHub
In your dev VM, open Visual Studio then open Team Explorer. Click on Manage Connections then click Clone 

Log into GitHub then select your repo making sure to change the local path to include your PackagesLocalDirectory path.

Click clone and wait. That's it. Your repo folder will look like this:

Callout: If using VHD, drive will be the C drive rather than K drive.
Conclusion
Very straight forward process. However, when using this style of package manage, you will only ever be allowed 1 package. You can add as many models as you like but you'll only ever have 1 package. This includes ISV packages as well including binary or source packages. I recommend this style of management for personal projects or something you'll be sharing on GitHub. I wouldn't recommend this approach for use on an implementation project.

Source Control      

Want to use Git with more than 1 Package? Let's review.
The process to get Git working with F&O can be a little involved and it may not make sense the first time. The issue we're presented with is that Git assumes you are starting with nothing - a directory that doesn't exist. When you fetch source code - clone it - Git wants you to clone it into a directory that doesn't exist yet. Our PackagesLocalDirectory very much so already exists. So, we have to help Git by moving in pieces of the repo into the directory then get everything back in working order. There are a few different ways to do this: The Hard Way, the easier way, and the easiest way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[what is a pull request? how do they work? what do they signify?
Create a Pull Request (PR)
The code is done but not the work. The developer still has to singal that his work is complete. We'll want to create a Pull Request or PR for short. There are 2 ways to do this. The first is in VS, which will just redirect you to Azure DevOps. The second is Azure DevOps. In VS, it can be found here:

In Azure DevOps, go to Repors, select your repo, select your branch then click "create a pull request".

Inside the PR, you can add some details for the PR. Additionally, reviewers and actions can be configured inside DevOps.

Notice you can select what you are creating a PR into. You can set a reviewer or additional reviewer if you'd like. Also notice that the PR is automagically associated with out bug work item. Let's create the PR.

As you can see, it merged successfully on its own and now we, or the approver, can approve and complete. Typically we wouldn't approve our own PRs. We'll see this when we complete.

We'll have an option for the merge type, if we want to use something different. Additionally, we have "complete associate work items after merging" checked as well as "delete bug200 after merging". This will resolve the bug setting it's status to done and deleting the branch we created for the work item called "bug200". Next, click "Complete merge". This is what the bug work item looks like after completing the PR:

The work item's status is "Done". Also note the links section. We can see that we had a commit and PR. However, the link to branch is now gone because the branch itself is gone.
Conclusion
Because Git Branches allow us to pull everything up, rather the push specific changesets like in TFVC, we can more easily keep track of what is where. As a for instance, until bug 200's work gets a completed PR, I know it's only in the branch for that work item.

I just want to re-iterate it and place here code snippets.



User can add new control using form personalization and this control won’t support overridden logic. It could be critical if you are restricting field lookup values or adding validations.
One form could have several controls that refers to one data source field so you have to duplicate your code.
Number of delegates are limited as well.

Bypass inventory reservations




A new parameter has appeared called Bypass inventory reservations, but what does it mean?




Release to Warehouse Credit Management Hold


There have been some observations made that when using the Release to warehouse Credit management checkpoint, the Sales order gets stuck in an infinite loop of going back on Credit hold after being released. This is occurring even if the order is Released to warehouse within the grace days defined. 





The Release to warehouse Credit management checkpoint in Credit and collections parameters



Microsoft has quietly released a fix for this in version 10.0.19 that is called Bypass inventory reservations. When this is enabled in the Credit and collections parameters, it will disregard inventory reservations when checking credit management blocking rules. Likewise, it will enable checkpoint grace periods regardless of inventory reservation quantity. 





Enable the Bypass inventory reservations parameter to avoid the Release to warehouse credit hold loop!





This has been a lifesaver for people who have found themselves stuck in an endless loop of Credit management holds when they try to release their Sales order from Credit hold then try to Release to warehouse!]]></summary>
